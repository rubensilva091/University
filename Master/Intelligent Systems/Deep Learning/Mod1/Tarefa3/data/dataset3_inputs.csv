D3-1;String theory is a broad and varied subject that attempts to address a number of deep questions of fundamental physics. String theory has contributed a number of advances to mathematical physics, which have been applied to a variety of problems in black hole physics, early universe cosmology, nuclear physics, and condensed matter physics, and it has stimulated a number of major developments in pure mathematics. Because string theory potentially provides a unified description of gravity and particle physics, it is a candidate for a theory of everything, a self-contained mathematical model that describes all fundamental forces and forms of matter. 
D3-2;String theory is a theoretical framework in physics that attempts to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity by proposing that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not point-like particles but tiny, vibrating strings. These strings oscillate at different frequencies, giving rise to various particles and forces, including gravity. String theory suggests the existence of multiple dimensions beyond the familiar three of space and one of time, often proposing up to 11 dimensions in M-theory. While it offers a potential “theory of everything,” unifying all fundamental forces, it remains theoretical due to the lack of experimental evidence. Researchers continue to explore its implications for black holes, cosmology, and quantum gravity.
D3-3;String theory proposes that the fundamental building blocks of the universe aren't point-like particles but tiny, vibrating one-dimensional strings. These microscopic strings, vibrating at different frequencies and patterns, give rise to different elementary particles like electrons, quarks, and force carriers. Remarkably, string theory attempts to unify quantum mechanics (governing the subatomic world) with general relativity (governing gravity and cosmic structures)—a holy grail in theoretical physics. To mathematically function, string theory requires extra spatial dimensions beyond our familiar three—typically proposing 10 or 11 dimensions total, with the extra dimensions compactified or curled up so small we can't detect them. While mathematically elegant and potentially revolutionary, string theory remains theoretical with no experimental verification yet, despite decades of development by brilliant physicists.
D3-4;I think string theory explains only the 3rd dimension as a whole which we are living in presently. It can explain everything that we can see and analysis from a third dimensional point of view and I will say it is a proof for mathematical and physical science “Gem that explains theory of everything in 3rd dimension “. Why I am saying it helps only on 3rd dimension and not 4th and higher dimension is that based on the proof that it explains boson particles can vibrate in 26 ways(dimension as on theory). But if we take a 3D model and plot the directions on the model from a single point of reference there will be 26 directions exactly.
D3-5;With all this said, one should keep in mind that string theory is in some sense only in its infancy, and, as such, is nowhere near answering all the questions we hoped it would, especially regarding what happens at singularities, though it has certainly led to interesting mathematics (4-manifolds, knot theory....). It can also be said that it has taught us much about the subject of strongly coupled quantum field theories via dualities. There are those who believe that string theory in the end will either have nothing to do with nature, or will never be testable, and as such will always be relegated to be mathematics or philosophy.
D3-6;String theory is a theoretical framework in physics that attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity, the two pillars of modern physics, into a single, all-encompassing theory. It posits that the fundamental particles, such as quarks and electrons, are not point-like dots but rather tiny, vibrating strings. These strings exist in a higher-dimensional spacetime—typically 10 or 11 dimensions—and their vibrational modes determine the properties of particles, such as mass and charge. String theory also incorporates the concept of supersymmetry, which hypothesizes a symmetry between bosons and fermions, suggesting that every known particle has a superpartner. While string theory has the potential to unify all fundamental forces, including gravity, it remains highly speculative due to the lack of experimental evidence.
D3-7;A covalent bond is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electrons to form electron pairs between atoms. These electron pairs are known as shared pairs or bonding pairs. The stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is known as covalent bonding. For many molecules, the sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain the equivalent of a full valence shell, corresponding to a stable electronic configuration. In organic chemistry, covalent bonding is much more common than ionic bonding. Covalent bonding also includes many kinds of interactions, including σ-bonding, π-bonding, metal-to-metal bonding, agostic interactions, bent bonds, three-center two-electron bonds and three-center four-electron bonds.
D3-8;Covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons to achieve stable electron configurations, typically following the octet rule where atoms seek eight valence electrons. Unlike ionic bonds that involve electron transfer between metals and non-metals, covalent bonds primarily occur between non-metal atoms with similar electronegativity values. The shared electron pairs create strong attractions between nuclei, forming discrete molecules rather than extended lattices. Common examples include water (H₂O), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and methane (CH₄). Covalent bonds vary in strength and can be classified as single, double, or triple bonds depending on how many electron pairs are shared. They also exhibit polarity when electron sharing is unequal, creating partial charges across the molecule.
D3-9;A covalent bond is a type of chemical bond where two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons to achieve stability. This typically occurs between nonmetal atoms, allowing them to fill their outer electron shells. Covalent bonds can be single, double, or triple, depending on the number of shared electron pairs. They are essential in forming molecules like water (H₂O), oxygen (O₂), and carbon dioxide (CO₂). These bonds can be polar, where electrons are shared unequally (as in H₂O), or nonpolar, where electrons are shared equally (as in O₂). Covalent bonds are generally strong and play a crucial role in biological molecules like DNA, proteins, and carbohydrates.
D3-10;Covalent bonds are a type of chemical bond where atoms share electron pairs to achieve a stable electron configuration, similar to noble gases. The sharing of electrons allows atoms to attain a full outer shell, enhancing stability. The nature of the bond—whether polar or nonpolar—depends on the electronegativity of the atoms involved. In polar bonds, one atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly than the other, while in nonpolar bonds, electrons are shared equally due to similar electronegativities. Covalent bonds can be single, double, or triple, depending on the number of electron pairs shared. Single bonds involve one pair, double bonds two pairs, and triple bonds three pairs.
D3-11;Driven by exciting developments in the field of nanotechnology, which is one of the most prominent research areas of our time, the demand of novel materials with precisely adjustable properties and structures has steadily increased, especially for the construction of electronic devices. The current approach following continuous downsizing of the structural patterns of silica-based semiconductors and other nanoelectronic devices is intrinsically limited by physical laws (top-down approach). To overcome this particular and important problem a promising, but chemically rather challenging alternative, the so called bottom-up approach, is nowadays extensively investigated. The underlying principle of this method is the linkage of nano-sized building block units to create larger areas of defined and highly ordered nanostructures with designed properties.
D3-12;Ionic bonding results from the electrostatic attraction of oppositely charged ions that are typically produced by the transfer of electrons between metallic and nonmetallic atoms. A different type of bonding results from the mutual attraction of atoms for a “shared” pair of electrons. Such bonds are called covalent bonds. Covalent bonds are formed between two atoms when both have similar tendencies to attract electrons to themselves (i.e., when both atoms have identical or fairly similar ionization energies and electron affinities). For example, two hydrogen atoms bond covalently to form an H2 molecule, each hydrogen atom in the H2 molecule has two electrons stabilizing it, giving each atom the same number of valence electrons as the noble gas
D3-13;Plate tectonics is the scientific theory explaining how Earth's lithosphere—the rigid outer layer consisting of the crust and uppermost mantle—is divided into several large and small plates that move relative to one another. These plates float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them, driven primarily by convection currents in the mantle. Where plates meet, three main types of boundaries form: convergent (plates collide, creating mountains and subduction zones), divergent (plates separate, forming rifts and mid-ocean ridges), and transform (plates slide past each other, causing earthquakes). This continuous movement, occurring at rates of 1-15 cm annually, explains diverse geological phenomena including mountain formation, earthquakes, volcanic activity, and continental drift. Developed in the 1960s, plate tectonics revolutionized our understanding of Earth's dynamic surface.
D3-14;Plate tectonics is the scientific theory that describes the movement of the Earth's lithosphere, which is divided into several large and small plates. These plates are composed of the Earth's crust and the upper mantle (lithosphere) and float on a semi-fluid layer of the mantle called the asthenosphere. The movement of these plates is driven by convection currents in the Earth's mantle, which are caused by heat from the Earth's core. As the plates move, they interact in various ways: when two plates collide, they can form mountain ranges like the Himalayas, when they move apart, rift valleys and mid-ocean ridges are created. Additionally, volcanic activity and earthquakes are common at plate boundaries.
D3-15;Tectonic plates are relatively rigid and float across the ductile asthenosphere beneath. Lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection currents, the slow creeping motion of Earth's solid mantle. At a seafloor spreading ridge, plates move away from the ridge, and the newly formed crust cools as it moves away, increasing its density and contributing to the motion. At a subduction zone, the relatively cold, dense oceanic crust sinks down into the mantle, forming the downward convecting limb of a mantle cell, which is the strongest driver of plate motion. The relative importance and interaction of other proposed factors such as active convection, upwelling inside the mantle, and tidal drag of the Moon is still the subject of debate.
D3-16;At present, young oceanic lithosphere is positively buoyant, and it does not become negatively buoyant until it is older than about 20 m.y. If, in the past, the mantle was hotter, the oceanic crust would have been thicker and the lithosphere's age of neutral buoyancy greater. On the other hand, the hotter mantle would have had a lower viscosity and convected faster, so the average age of oceanic plates at subduction would have been less than the present 100 m.y. At some time in the past, average oceanic lithosphere would have only just become negatively buoyant as it reached a subduction zone.
D3-17;Plate tectonics is the scientific theory that explains the movement of Earth’s lithospheric plates, which float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them. These plates constantly shift due to convection currents in the Earth’s mantle, leading to interactions at their boundaries. There are three main types of plate boundaries: divergent, where plates move apart (forming mid-ocean ridges), convergent, where they collide (creating mountains or subduction zones), and transform, where they slide past each other (causing earthquakes). Plate tectonics is responsible for earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain formation, and continental drift. It also plays a crucial role in Earth’s climate regulation and geological evolution, shaping the planet’s surface over millions of years.
D3-18;Developed from the 1950s through the 1970s, plate tectonics is the modern version of continental drift, a theory first proposed by scientist Alfred Wegener in 1912. Wegener didn't have an explanation for how continents could move around the planet, but researchers do now. Plate tectonics is the unifying theory of geology, said Nicholas van der Elst, a seismologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, New York. Before plate tectonics, people had to come up with explanations of the geologic features in their region that were unique to that particular region,Van der Elst said. Plate tectonics unified all these descriptions and said that you should be able to describe all geologic features.
D3-19;Introductory textbooks contrast Lamarckism with Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. However, Darwin's book On the Origin of Species gave credence to the idea of heritable effects of use and disuse, as Lamarck had done, and his own concept of pangenesis similarly implied soft inheritance. Many researchers from the 1860s onwards attempted to find evidence for Lamarckian inheritance, but these have all been explained away,[4][5] either by other mechanisms such as genetic contamination or as fraud. August Weismann's experiment, considered definitive in its time, is now considered to have failed to disprove Lamarckism, as it did not address use and disuse. Later, Mendelian genetics supplanted the notion of inheritance of acquired traits´.
D3-20;The first meaning of Lamarckism is the notion that acquired characters can or will be inherited. Jean Baptiste de Lamarck strongly promoted this idea, but it was not original to him.Footnote2 We discuss this notion of Lamarckism extensively below. A second strong theme in the writings of Lamarck, which he developed rather than originated, is the idea that evolution involves increasing complexity. Although later Lamarckians such as Herbert Spencer took up this idea, it has today grown beyond its Lamarckian associations, and is rarely associated specifically with the Lamarckian label. A third use of the Lamarckian label associates it with the emphasis on will, choice, anticipation, or volitional activity in the process of evolutionary change. 
D3-21;Lamarck’s theory of evolution, proposed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in the early 19th century, suggested that organisms evolve through the inheritance of acquired characteristics. He believed that traits developed during an organism’s lifetime, due to use or disuse, could be passed on to offspring. For example, he theorized that giraffes developed long necks because they stretched to reach higher leaves, and this trait was inherited by their descendants. While his ideas were later disproven by modern genetics and Darwin’s theory of natural selection, Lamarck played a key role in early evolutionary thought. His work contributed to the understanding that species change over time, even though the mechanism he proposed was incorrect.
D3-22;It remains to be seen whether or not epigenetics will actually have any significant impact as an evolutionary mechanism. The issue is that, so far, we have no evidence that epigenetic alterations can persist over evolutionarily relevant periods of time. The alterations in gene expression that occur in the offspring are wholly reversible, and while there are some examples where we see the changes linger over a handful of generations, most of the time they are erased by the time the affected offspring has its own offspring. Barring additional mutations (which is a Neo-Darwinian mechanism) there is no permanent alteration in the heritable information passed down to future generations in the long term.
D3-23;Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's theory of evolution, proposed in the early 19th century, centers on two key principles: the law of use and disuse, and the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Lamarck suggested that organisms develop traits based on their needs, with frequently used body parts becoming stronger and enlarged, while unused parts atrophy. Crucially, he claimed these acquired modifications could be passed to offspring. His classic example described giraffes stretching to reach high leaves, gradually elongating their necks over generations. Lamarck also proposed that all organisms have an inherent drive toward increasing complexity. Though largely discredited by modern genetics—which shows acquired physical changes don't alter heritable DNA—his work represented an important early attempt to explain species adaptation and diversity.
D3-24;Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's theory of evolution, developed in the early 19th century, proposed that organisms can acquire traits during their lifetimes through the use or disuse of body parts, and these traits can be inherited by their offspring. Lamarck's theory emphasized two main ideas: the use and disuse of organs and the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Use and Disuse: Lamarck suggested that frequent use of certain body parts leads to their development and strengthening, while parts that are rarely used atrophy. For example, he might argue that giraffes developed longer necks by repeatedly stretching to reach higher foliage, and these elongated necks were then passed on to their offspring.
D3-25;Michaelis-Menten kinetics is a fundamental model in biochemistry that describes how the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction changes with the concentration of its substrate. This model, developed by Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten, helps us understand the relationship between an enzyme's activity and the amount of substrate available. At low substrate concentrations, the reaction rate increases as more substrate becomes available, allowing the enzyme to become more active. However, as the substrate concentration continues to increase, the enzyme becomes fully occupied, reaching a point where the reaction rate no longer increases—this is known as the maximum reaction rate, or Vmax.
D3-26;The equation commonly called the Michaelis–Menten equation is sometimes attributed to other authors. However, although Victor Henri had derived the equation from the correct mechanism, and Adrian Brown before him had proposed the idea of enzyme saturation, it was Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten who showed that this mechanism could also be deduced on the basis of an experimental approach that paid proper attention to pH and spontaneous changes in the product after formation in the enzyme-catalysed reaction. By using initial rates of reaction they avoided the complications due to substrate depletion, product accumulation and progressive inactivation of the enzyme that had made attempts to analyse complete time courses very difficult.
D3-27;A system in a steady state condition is ordinarily one in which there is a continuous flow of matter and energy through it but where none of the rates or concentrations change with time. That is never the case in a typical enzyme kinetics experiment where you start with a solution of enzyme, substrate, and buffer and the reaction continues with steadily changing reaction rate, substrate concentration, and product concentration until it reaches an equilibrium and there is no longer any net reaction. That equilibrium is a very special case of steady state. However inside a cell there may be situations that persist for a while where, for example, a constant input of glucose transported into the cell. 
D3-28;Michaelis-Menten kinetics, developed by Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten in 1913, describes the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions involving single substrate transformation into products. The model mathematically relates reaction velocity to substrate concentration through a hyperbolic curve characterized by two key parameters: the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) when all enzyme is saturated, and the Michaelis constant (KM), which equals the substrate concentration at half-maximum velocity. This relationship is expressed by the equation: v = (Vmax[S])/(KM + [S]), where v is reaction velocity and [S] is substrate concentration At low substrate concentrations, the reaction is first-order with respect to substrate, while at high concentrations, it approaches zero-order kinetics as the enzyme becomes saturated.
D3-29;Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics describes how enzymes catalyze reactions by forming an enzyme-substrate complex. It explains the relationship between substrate concentration and reaction rate using the Michaelis-Menten equation: V = V_max [S]/{K_m + [S]), where V is the reaction rate, Vₘₐₓ is the maximum velocity, [S] is the substrate concentration, and Kₘ (Michaelis constant) represents the substrate concentration at half Vₘₐₓ. A low Kₘ indicates high enzyme affinity for the substrate, while a high Kₘ suggests lower affinity. This model assumes steady-state conditions and is fundamental in understanding enzyme efficiency, inhibition, and drug design. However, it applies mainly to simple, single-substrate reactions and does not account for complex enzyme behaviors.
D3-30;Enzyme kinetics is the study of the rates of enzyme-catalysed chemical reactions. In enzyme kinetics, the reaction rate is measured and the effects of varying the conditions of the reaction are investigated. Studying an enzyme's kinetics in this way can reveal the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme, its role in metabolism, how its activity is controlled, and how a drug or a modifier (inhibitor or activator) might affect the rate. An enzyme (E) is a protein molecule that serves as a biological catalyst to facilitate and accelerate a chemical reaction in the body. It does this through binding of another molecule, its substrate (S), which the enzyme acts upon to form the desired product.
D3-31;The potential for an H5N1 pandemic is a significant public health concern, though currently, the risk is relatively low. H5N1 is a subtype of the Influenza A virus primarily found in birds, with occasional transmission to humans. Its high mortality rate among infected individuals underscores the concern, but the virus's limited human-to-human transmissibility has thus far prevented pandemic spread. Key considerations include: Mutation Potential: The virus could mutate to become more contagious, increasing the risk of a pandemic. This underscores the importance of continuous surveillance to detect such mutations early. Preventive Measures: Global health organizations are working on vaccines and medications to control outbreaks. These efforts must be supported with robust infrastructure to ensure equitable distribution, especially in resource-limited regions.
D3-32;The H5N1 virus is a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza (bird flu) that primarily affects birds but can infect humans and other animals. It was first detected in geese in China in 1996 and has since caused outbreaks in poultry worldwide. Human infections are rare but can be severe, with a high fatality rate, often due to respiratory complications. Transmission occurs mainly through direct contact with infected birds or contaminated environments, but human-to-human spread is very limited. Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, and severe pneumonia. Due to its potential to mutate and cause a pandemic, H5N1 is closely monitored by health organizations, and vaccines are being developed to counter its threat.
D3-33;Ongoing outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in migratory waterfowl, domestic poultry, and humans in Asia during the summer of 2005 present a continuing, protean pandemic threat. We review the zoonotic source of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses and their genesis from their natural reservoirs. The acquisition of novel traits, including lethality to waterfowl, ferrets, felids, and humans, indicates an expanding host range. The natural selection of nonpathogenic viruses from heterogeneous subpopulations cocirculating in ducks contributes to the spread of H5N1 in Asia. Transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western China has increased the geographic spread. The spread of H5N1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines.
D3-34;Since 2020, outbreaks of avian influenza subtype H5N1 have been occurring, with cases reported from every continent except Australia as of February 2025. Some species of wild aquatic birds act as natural asymptomatic carriers of a large variety of influenza A viruses, which can infect poultry, other bird species, mammals (including humans) if they come into close contact with infected feces or contaminated material, or by eating infected birds. In late 2023, H5N1 was discovered in the Antarctic for the first time, raising fears of imminent spread throughout the region, potentially leading to a catastrophic breeding failure among animals that had not previously been exposed to avian influenza viruses.
D3-35;H5N1 is a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that has been affecting numerous wild and domestic bird species worldwide over past decades. Since 1996, it has circulated in at least 23 countries, spreading from Europe to North America in late 2021 and to South America in 2022, where it devastated bird populations and marine mammals. The situation has become more concerning recently with H5N1 adapting to new mammalian hosts There have been several concerning reports in 2024 including the first H5N1-related human death in the United States, reported by the Louisiana Department of Health in 2025. Scientists consider H5N1 a strong contender to cause the next human influenza pandemic. The primary concern is the virus's ongoing adaptation to mammals.
D3-36;Asian HPAI H5N1 was first detected in humans in 1997 during a poultry outbreak in Hong Kong and has since been detected in poultry and wild birds in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. H5N1 is a type of influenza virus called avian influenza (or bird flu). Human cases of avian influenza occur occasionally, viruses infect the respiratory tract of humans, causing severe illness (e.g. pneumonia and respiratory failure) and death in some people. Asian flu is most often contracted by contact with sick birds. It can also be passed from person to person. Symptoms begin within two to eight days, and can seem like the common flu.
D3-37;An anticyclone is a weather system characterized by high atmospheric pressure at its center, causing air to descend and spread outward. This descending air inhibits cloud formation, leading to clear skies and stable weather conditions. In the Northern Hemisphere, anticyclones rotate clockwise, while in the Southern Hemisphere, they rotate counterclockwise, due to the Coriolis effect. They often bring dry, calm, and sunny weather, but in winter, they can cause cold temperatures and fog. Anticyclones can last for days or even weeks, influencing regional climates by blocking storm systems. These systems contrast with cyclones, which involve low pressure and rising air, often leading to storms and heavy precipitation.
D3-38;High-pressure areas form due to downward motion through the troposphere, the atmospheric layer where weather occurs. Preferred areas within a synoptic flow pattern in higher levels of the troposphere are beneath the western side of troughs. On weather maps, these areas show converging winds (isotachs), also known as convergence, near or above the level of non-divergence, which is near the 500 hPa pressure surface about midway up through the troposphere, and about half the atmospheric pressure at the surface. High pressure systems are also called anticyclones. On English-language weather maps, high-pressure centers are identified by the letter H in English, within the isobar with the highest pressure value.
D3-39;Cyclones are typically regions of bad weather, anticyclones are usually meteorologically quiet and calm regions. Anticyclones are downward air motions and provide dry stable air that may extend horizontally over a location. It affects the weather pattern as anticyclonic circulation is opposed to the Earth's rotation. Winds, generally light, circulate the high-pressure center in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Air at the center of an anticyclone is moved away from the high pressure and is replaced in the center by a downward draft of air from higher altitudes. As this air moves downward, it is compressed and warmed, resulting in few clouds and low humidity in the anticyclone.
D3-40;An anticyclone is a weather system characterized by a region of high atmospheric pressure relative to the surrounding areas. In weather maps, anticyclones are denoted by 'H' and represent areas where air is sinking, which results in dry and stable conditions. This sinking air warms and compresses, leading to clear skies and often calm weather. Wind patterns around an anticyclone blow clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere due to the Earth's rotation, a phenomenon known as the Coriolis effect. Anticyclones typically bring sunny, dry weather, making them associated with good conditions. However, they can occasionally result in fog or smog, especially in areas with poor air circulation, as the stable air layer traps pollutants.
D3-41;Polyphenols are a group of naturally occurring compounds found in plants. They are characterized by their chemical structure and have been recognized for their potential health benefits. Polyphenols act as antioxidants, meaning they can help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. Polyphenols have gained significant attention due to their potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. They can act as antioxidants by scavenging and neutralizing harmful free radicals in the body, thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage. Polyphenols are found in a wide variety of plant-based foods, including: Fruits: Berries (such as blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries), cherries, grapes, apples, pears, citrus fruits (such as oranges, lemons, and grapefruits), pomegranates, and avocados.
D3-42;The anthocyanins present in blackberries and raspberries are important for the beneficial health effects associated with their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and chemopreventative properties, the biological activity of black raspberry against esophageal, colon, and oral cancers has been demonstrated. It has long been established that cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside are the respective major and minor anthocyanins in blackberries (Fan-Chiang and Wrolstad, 2005). It is also known that cyanidin-3-sambubioside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside are commonly found in black raspberries. In addition to anthocyanins, these fruits are also a rich natural source of other chemopreventative phytochemicals such as flavonols, phenolic acids, ellagic acid, vitamins C and E, folic acid and β-sitosterol.
D3-43;Anthocyanins are natural pigments responsible for the vibrant red, blue, and purple hues in many fruits, vegetables, and flowers. As potent antioxidants, they play a crucial role in protecting the body from oxidative stress, which is associated with various chronic diseases. Found abundantly in berries, grapes, and certain vegetables, anthocyanins have been studied for their potential in reducing inflammation, enhancing heart health, and potentially offering protection against cancer. Their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties make them a focal point in both nutrition and medical research, highlighting their significant role in promoting overall health and preventing chronic conditions. Incorporating anthocyanin-rich foods into the diet may provide substantial health benefits, contributing to well-being and longevity.
D3-44;Anthocyanins are found in the cell vacuole, mostly in flowers and fruits, but also in leaves, stems, and roots. In these parts, they are found predominantly in outer cell layers such as the epidermis and peripheral mesophyll cells. Most frequently occurring in nature are the glycosides of cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, and petunidin. Roughly 2% of all hydrocarbons fixed in photosynthesis are converted into flavonoids and their derivatives, such as the anthocyanins. Not all land plants contain anthocyanin, in the Caryophyllales (including cactus, beets, and amaranth), they are replaced by betalains. Anthocyanins and betalains have never been found in the same plant.
D3-45;Anthocyanins are pigments belonging to the flavonoid family, responsible for the red, purple, and blue colors in many fruits, vegetables, and flowers. Found in berries, grapes, red cabbage, and black rice, they serve as antioxidants, helping to neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress. Studies suggest anthocyanins may have potential health benefits, including anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular, neuroprotective, and anti-cancer properties. They may also support eye health, improve cognitive function, and help regulate blood sugar levels. Additionally, their natural pigmentation makes them useful as natural food colorants. Ongoing research explores their role in disease prevention and their potential applications in functional foods and pharmaceuticals.
D3-46;Anthocyanins are water-soluble plant pigments belonging to the flavonoid family that create the vivid red, purple, and blue colors in fruits, vegetables, and flowers. Abundant in berries, grapes, red cabbage, and purple sweet potatoes, these compounds represent one of nature's most powerful antioxidant classes. Research indicates significant health-promoting potential, including anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties. Studies suggest anthocyanins may help manage diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity, reduce cancer risk through multiple mechanisms, and support vision health. Their pH-sensitive color-changing properties make them valuable as natural food colorants and pH indicators in various applications. The food industry increasingly uses anthocyanin-rich extracts as alternatives to synthetic dyes, while researchers continue exploring their pharmaceutical potential in preventing chronic diseases.
D3-47;The evolutionary mechanisms that lead to codon reassignment and emergence of deviant codes are not thoroughly understood, but clearly they must involve changes in tRNA specificity or to the evolution of new specificities in the case of stop codon recruitment. Sengupta, Higgs, and coworkers  have captured these mechanisms within a gain and loss framework, where gain refers to acquisition of a new tRNA specificity, often following duplication of a tRNA gene, and loss refers to the elimination of a tRNA specificity, typically via deletion. There is no clear evidence that any modern code variants are associated with adaptation. Most likely, they emerge via neutral evolutionary processes, namely genetic drift and mutational pressure that drives small genomes toward low GC content.
D3-48;The origin of the genetic code remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. It is believed to have emerged in early RNA-based life forms before the evolution of DNA and proteins. One theory suggests that the first genetic molecules were self-replicating RNA strands, which could both store information and catalyze chemical reactions. Over time, specific nucleotide sequences began coding for amino acids, leading to the formation of simple peptides. As natural selection favored more efficient protein synthesis, the code evolved into a triplet system to accommodate 20 amino acids. The universality of the genetic code suggests a common ancestor for all life, shaped by early biochemical constraints and evolutionary pressures.
D3-49;Within cells, genetic information is stored in DNA molecules and RNA molecules. These molecules are made up of building blocks called nucleotides that are linked together in a chain. There are 4 kinds of nucleotide, with names beginning with letters A,C, T, and G. Messenger RNA is transcribed from sequences in the DNA called genes. Proteins are a different kind of molecule that is made of 20 different kinds of amino acid building blocks. There is a molecular machine called a ribosome that uses a program consisting of a messenger RNA molecule. Sequences of 3 nucleotides encode one amino acid for that the ribosome puts together to make the protein. 
D3-50;The emergence of the genetic code remains one of biology's greatest mysteries. The leading theory—the RNA world hypothesis—suggests that RNA initially served both as genetic material and catalyst before DNA and proteins evolved. Early protocells likely used simple nucleotide systems that gradually developed into more complex coding mechanisms. The modern code likely evolved through a process of chemical constraints, frozen accidents, and natural selection. Selection pressures would have favored error minimization, with similar amino acids often assigned to similar codons. The code's near-universality across all life forms suggests it emerged only once, about 3.5-4 billion years ago. Later refinements optimized the system, balancing robustness against mutations with translation efficiency.
D2-1;The Solar System faces a dramatic future over billions of years. In approximately 5-7 billion years, our Sun will exhaust its hydrogen fuel and expand into a red giant, likely engulfing Mercury and Venus. Earth may either be consumed or rendered uninhabitable as oceans and atmosphere evaporate. The outer planets will survive but experience significant changes in temperature and orbital dynamics. Eventually, the Sun will shed its outer layers, creating a planetary nebula while its core collapses into a white dwarf star. This white dwarf will slowly cool over trillions of years, leaving our former solar neighborhood incredibly dim. Any surviving planets will orbit in perpetual darkness, frozen and lifeless.
D2-10;The origin of angiosperms (flowering plants) represents what Charles Darwin famously called an abominable mystery due to their apparent sudden appearance and rapid diversification in the fossil record. Modern research combines multiple lines of evidence to address this evolutionary puzzle. The fossil record shows unequivocal angiosperm evidence beginning in the Early Cretaceous (approximately 125-130 million years ago), with remarkably diverse forms appearing within 20-30 million years. Key early fossils include Archaefructus and Montsechia, with water lily relatives among the earliest documented flowering plants. Molecular evidence, however, suggests an earlier origin than fossils indicate. DNA-based phylogenies identify Amborella, water lilies, and Austrobaileyales as the earliest-diverging lineages. Molecular clock analyses often place angiosperm origins in the Jurassic period (145-201 million years ago).
D2-14;Molecular data on relationships within angiosperms confirm the view that their increasing morphological diversity through the Cretaceous reflected their evolutionary radiation. Despite the early appearance of aquatics and groups with simple flowers, the record is consistent with inferences from molecular trees that the first angiosperms were woody plants with pinnately veined leaves, multiparted flowers, uniovulate ascidiate carpels, and columellar monosulcate pollen. Molecular data appear to refute the hypothesis based on morphology that angiosperms and Gnetales are closest living relatives. Morphological analyses of living and fossil seed plants that assume molecular relationships identify glossopterids, Bennettitales, and Caytonia as angiosperm relatives, these results are consistent with proposed homologies between the cupule of glossopterids and Caytonia and the angiosperm bitegmic ovule. 
D2-19;Schrödinger's cat is a famous thought experiment proposed by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935 to illustrate the apparent paradoxes of quantum mechanics. It involves a hypothetical scenario where a cat is placed in a sealed box with a radioactive atom, a Geiger counter, and a poison mechanism. If the radioactive atom decays (a random quantum event), the poison is released, killing the cat. According to quantum mechanics, until observed, the radioactive atom exists in a superposition of both decayed and undecayed states. This implies the cat would be simultaneously both alive and dead until someone opens the box to check. The experiment highlights the disconnect between quantum mechanical principles and our everyday experience of reality, challenging our understanding of observation.
D2-20;For a fossil to exist it needs to survive a long time. Many animals are active kills by predictors. In such cases one might find a few teeth but most bone and tissue is gone. In rain forests the amount of insects make finding anything unlikely. Any animal is quickly dissected. Bones often dissolve in the slightly acid rain. Good places to find fossils are hence riverbeds or banks where cold freezing water quickly kills the animal and sediments are readily available to bury the remains long enough to begin the next step in the fossilization process. Similarly lakes that break through a wall and empty might evaporate and have large amount of fish and other animals.
D2-28;Fossils have played a significant role in shaping Greek mythology, as ancient Greeks often interpreted large, mysterious bones as evidence of mythical creatures. The discovery of massive fossils, such as those of mammoths, mastodons, and prehistoric reptiles, likely influenced myths about giants, cyclopes, and dragons. For instance, the large skulls of prehistoric elephants, which have a central nasal cavity, may have been mistaken for the skulls of one-eyed Cyclopes, reinforcing the legend of these formidable beings. Similarly, fossilized bones of large extinct animals could have inspired stories of titans and heroes slaying monstrous beasts. Greek naturalists like Herodotus and Pliny the Elder documented fossil findings, showing early attempts to explain these remains within a mythological and historical framework.
D2-29;Synthetic biology emerged as a specialized branch of bioengineering over the last 15-20 years, propelled by the technologies of DNA sequencing and DNA synthesis. The emphasis is now on characterizing molecular components and standardizing them so that they work together. Today, computer programming languages have become more abstract by building upon previous languages, making it easier and faster to create complex programs. Similarly, in the future, standardized molecular components will make biology understandable through abstraction. This will in turn make it easier to engineer new functions. Of course any biological abstraction would rely on molecular details (just like all computer code is finally executed as assembly), so studying molecular biology is very worthwhile. 
D2-32;Synthetic biology is bringing together engineers and biologists to design and build novel biomolecular components, networks and pathways, and to use these constructs to rewire and reprogram organisms. These re-engineered organisms will change our lives over the coming years, leading to cheaper drugs, 'green' means to fuel our cars and targeted therapies for attacking 'superbugs' and diseases, such as cancer. The de novo engineering of genetic circuits, biological modules and synthetic pathways is beginning to address these crucial problems and is being used in related practical applications. The circuit-like connectivity of biological parts and their ability to collectively process logical operations was first appreciated nearly 50 years ago.
D2-33;Computational systems biology is an emerging field in biological simulation that attempts to model or simulate intra- and intercellular events using data gathered from genomic, proteomic or metabolomic experiments. The need to model complex temporal and spatiotemporal processes at many different scales has led to the emergence of numerous techniques, including systems of differential equations, Petri nets, cellular automata simulators, agent-based models and pi calculus. This review provides a brief summary and an assessment of most of these approaches. It also provides examples of how these methods are being used to facilitate drug discovery and development. Systems biology is a newly emerging, multi-disciplinary field that studies the mechanisms underlying complex biological processes by treating these processes as integrated systems. 
D2-34;The main causes of lung cancer are primarily linked to smoking and environmental exposures. Tobacco smoking is the leading cause, responsible for about 85% of cases, as the harmful chemicals in smoke damage DNA in lung cells. Secondhand smoke is also a significant risk factor. Another major cause is exposure to radon gas, a naturally occurring radioactive substance that can accumulate in buildings. Occupational exposures to substances like asbestos, arsenic, and diesel exhaust also increase the risk, particularly in certain industries. Additionally, genetic factors and family history can make some individuals more susceptible, while air pollution and poor air quality further contribute to the development of lung cancer.
D2-35;Einstein and Schrödinger exchanged significant ideas throughout their careers. Both physicists shared deep skepticism about the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, maintaining a correspondence that revealed their mutual discomfort with quantum indeterminism. Einstein's famous quote, God does not play dice with the universe, echoed Schrödinger's own reservations. Their intellectual relationship flourished through letters and occasional meetings, where they discussed unified field theory and the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics. Schrödinger's cat thought experiment partially emerged from these discussions, attempting to illustrate what both considered absurdities in quantum theory. Though they never resolved their concerns about quantum mechanics, their dialogue represented one of the most profound scientific exchanges of the 20th century, challenging mainstream quantum interpretations while searching for deeper truths.
D2-36;Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large, complex group of synthetic chemicals that have been used in consumer products worldwide since the 1950s. These compounds serve as ingredients in various everyday products, with applications ranging from industrial uses to consumer goods due to their unique water and oil-repellent properties. PFAS are often referred to as forever chemicals due to their extraordinary environmental persistence They represent persistent contaminants that are particularly challenging to address through conventional wastewater treatment processes Their persistence has made them contaminants of emerging concern in industrialized countries, where they accumulate in the environment over time. Research indicates that PFAS exposure poses significant health risks: PFAS disrupt biological membranes resulting in cellular inhibition.
D2-38;The variation in PFAS regulatory values across the globe can be easily addressed due to the influence of multiple scientific, technical, and social factors. The varied toxicology and the insufficient definition of PFAS exposure rate are among the main factors contributing to this discrepancy. The lack of proven standard approaches for examining PFAS in surface water, groundwater, wastewater, or solids adds more technical complexity. Although it is agreed that PFASs pose potential health risks in various media, the link between the extent of PFAS exposure and the significance of PFAS risk remain among the evolving research areas. There is a growing need to address the correlation between the frequency and the likelihood of human exposure to PFAS .
D2-40;An unexpected emergent property of a complex system may be a result of the interplay of the cause-and-effect among simpler, integrated parts (see biological organisation). Biological systems manifest many important examples of emergent properties in the complex interplay of components. Traditional study of biological systems requires reductive methods in which quantities of data are gathered by category, such as concentration over time in response to a certain stimulus. Computers are critical to analysis and modelling of these data. The goal is to create accurate real-time models of a system's response to environmental and internal stimuli, such as a model of a cancer cell in order to find weaknesses in its signalling pathways.
D2-43;Early lung cancer often has no symptoms and can only be detected by medical imaging. As the cancer progresses, most people experience nonspecific respiratory problems: coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Other symptoms depend on the location and size of the tumor. Those suspected of having lung cancer typically undergo a series of imaging tests to determine the location and extent of any tumors. Definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires a biopsy of the suspected tumor be examined by a pathologist under a microscope. . In addition to recognizing cancerous cells, a pathologist can classify the tumor according to the type of cells it originates from. 
D2-44;To further illustrate, Schrödinger described how one could, in principle, create a superposition in a large-scale system by making it dependent on a quantum particle that was in a superposition. He proposed a scenario with a cat in a closed steel chamber, wherein the cat's life or death depended on the state of a radioactive atom, whether it had decayed and emitted radiation or not. According to Schrödinger, the Copenhagen interpretation implies that the cat remains both alive and dead until the state has been observed. Schrödinger did not wish to promote the idea of dead-and-live cats as a serious possibility. On the contrary, he intended the example to illustrate the absurdity of the existing view of quantum mechanics
D2-45;Educational robotics teaches the design, analysis, application and operation of robots. Robots include articulated robots, mobile robots or autonomous vehicles. Educational robotics can be taught from elementary school to graduate programs. Robotics may also be used to motivate and facilitate the instruction other, often foundational, topics such as computer programming, artificial intelligence or engineering design. Robotics engineers design robots, maintain them, develop new applications for them, and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics. Robots have become a popular educational tool in some middle and high schools, as well as in numerous youth summer camps, raising interest in programming, artificial intelligence and robotics among students.
D2-47;Systems Biology is not one thing, and is quite different to different people. In my view Systems Biology is really a modern perspective on doing basic Biology research. It is not really an applied field, intending to directly be useful for industry and make products. Instead it aims to unlock the key principles of life, which can be used to do that thereafter. However, a lot of the processes of Systems Biology involves using cutting edge tools, especially computational ones, which can give you a good handle on the process of being a “data scientist”, handling large amount of experimentally obtained data, processing and analyzing it to make decisions about future course of actions.
D2-48;Educational robotics represents an innovative approach to learning that combines technology with hands-on experience, offering numerous benefits for students across different age groups. Educational robotics provides a strong foundation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). As students engage with robotics, they naturally develop capabilities in these critical disciplines, preparing them for future academic and career challenges. This approach is increasingly viewed as a strategic way to introduce and incentivize students to pursue careers in STEM fields. Beyond technical knowledge, robotics education cultivates essential life skills that benefit students regardless of their eventual career path. Students working with robotics develop problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and resilience when facing challenges.
D2-50;The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury as well as Venus, and render Earth and Mars uninhabitable (possibly destroying Earth as well). Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion, the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will be ejected into space, leaving behind a dense white dwarf, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers may form a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun.
D2-51;The Big Bang theory is the predominant scientific explanation for our universe's origin, describing not an explosion but rather how the universe expanded from an initial state of extreme density and temperature approximately 13.8 billion years ago. This initial state, called a singularity, contained all matter in an incredibly hot, dense point before expansion began. Proposed by physicist Georges Lemaître in 1927, the theory is supported by multiple lines of evidence, including the cosmic microwave background radiation (essentially the Big Bang's afterglow) and the abundance of light elements in the universe. Later refinements include cosmic inflation theory, suggesting that the early universe briefly expanded faster than light speed.
D2-56;Metabolic engineering is a specialized field that focuses on optimizing metabolic pathways in organisms to enhance the production of desired products, such as biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals. Applications include the development of microbes or cells capable of efficiently producing high-value compounds, improving the yield and sustainability of chemical manufacturing, and enhancing the production of bio-based materials. It also plays a key role in environmental biotechnology, such as detoxifying pollutants or remediating soil and water. Additionally, metabolic engineering is used to improve agricultural crops by enhancing their nutrient content, stress tolerance, or resistance to pests. By tailoring metabolic pathways, it enables the creation of novel therapeutic agents, advanced biofuels, and sustainable industrial processes.
D2-57;In modern terms Schrodinger's hypothetical cat experiment describes the measurement problem: quantum theory describes the cat system as a combination of two possible outcomes but only one outcome is ever observed.  The experiment poses the question, when does a quantum system stop existing as a superposition of states and become one or the other? (More technically, when does the actual quantum state stop being a non-trivial linear combination of states, each of which resembles different classical states, and instead begin to have a unique classical description?) Standard microscopic quantum mechanics describes multiple possible outcomes of experiments but only one outcome is observed. The thought experiment illustrates this apparent paradox. 
D2-58;The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model explaining the origin and evolution of the universe. It proposes that the universe began approximately 13.8 billion years ago as an extremely hot and dense point, which rapidly expanded in a process called inflation. As the universe expanded and cooled, fundamental particles and then atoms formed, eventually leading to the creation of stars, galaxies, and other cosmic structures. Observational evidence, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation (leftover heat from the early universe) and the abundance of light elements, strongly supports this theory. The Big Bang also explains the universe's large-scale structure and the observed redshift of distant galaxies, which indicates the ongoing expansion of space.
D2-59;Synthetic biology, which aims to design or assemble biological parts for useful applications, has emerged as a transformative field with wide-ranging implications across multiple sectors. Synthetic biology has significant medical applications, including improving drug discovery and development through rapid screening of DNA sequences, often leveraging AI and machine learning to identify promising drug candidates. The field enables production of therapeutic molecules with precise targeting and efficacy, and advances antibody and vaccine production. Researchers are engineering biological systems that could potentially treat complex diseases such as cancer. In industrial settings, synthetic biology enables the creation of cell factories that can efficiently produce valuable compounds. Applications include: Biofuel production through engineered microorganisms, Production of pharmaceuticals and biomaterials using biological systems 
D2-60;The dangers of PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, stem from their persistence in the environment and their ability to bioaccumulate in living organisms. Known as 'forever chemicals,' PFAS do not break down easily, leading to long-term environmental contamination. They are found in products like non-stick cookware, firefighting foam, and water-repellent textiles. PFAS can enter the human body through contaminated drinking water and food, particularly in areas near industrial sites. Prolonged exposure has been linked to serious health issues, including certain cancers, hormonal disruptions, and weakened immune systems. Additionally, PFAS contribute to ecosystem harm by affecting wildlife and biodiversity. Their long-lasting nature makes them a significant environmental and public health concern, as they are challenging to eliminate.
D2-62;Educational robotics offers a wealth of advantages, particularly in promoting interactive and hands-on learning, fostering creativity, and encouraging teamwork. By providing practical applications for theoretical concepts, it strengthens students' understanding of STEM subjects such as motion and forces. Adding to this, it equips students with technical skills relevant to modern industries and cater to various learning styles, including visual and kinesthetic learning, especially benefiting students with disabilities. Furthermore, robotics offers immediate feedback, enabling students to quickly identify and correct mistakes, which reinforces their learning process. Its fun and interactive nature boosts motivation and engagement, instilling a positive attitude toward education. In essence, educational robotics not only enhances academic learning but also prepares students for the demands of the 21st-century workforce.
D2-65;Understanding Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) hydrology is essential for evaluating response of ice dynamics to a warming climate and future contributions to global sea level rise. Recently observed increases in temperature and melt extent over the GrIS have prompted numerous remote sensing, modeling, and field studies gauging the response of the ice sheet and outlet glaciers to increasing meltwater input, providing a quickly growing body of literature describing seasonal and annual development of the GrIS hydrologic system. This system is characterized by supraglacial streams and lakes that drain through moulins, providing an influx of meltwater into englacial and subglacial environments that increases basal sliding speeds of outlet glaciers in the short term.
D2-66;Computational systems biology is crucial for understanding the complexity of biological systems through the integration of mathematical modeling, computer simulations, and data analysis. It enables researchers to study how genes, proteins, and metabolic pathways interact in a holistic manner, rather than in isolation. This approach is essential for deciphering the dynamics of biological networks, such as gene regulatory networks, signaling pathways, and metabolic systems. The importance of computational systems biology lies in its ability to predict biological behaviors, identify potential drug targets, and develop personalized medicine strategies. It also helps in understanding diseases at a systems level, enabling the identification of biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.
D2-68;The ultimate goal of metabolic engineering is to be able to use these organisms to produce valuable substances on an industrial scale in a cost-effective manner. Current examples include producing beer, wine, cheese, pharmaceuticals, and other biotechnology products. Another possible area of use is the development of oil crops whose composition has been modified to improve their nutritional value. Some of the common strategies used for metabolic engineering are (1) overexpressing the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme of the biosynthetic pathway, (2) blocking the competing metabolic pathways, (3) heterologous gene expression, and (4) enzyme engineering. Since cells use these metabolic networks for their survival, changes can have drastic effects on the cells' viability. 
D2-71;Metabolic engineering is the field of biotechnology that involves the modification of an organism’s metabolic pathways to enhance the production of desired products, such as chemicals, fuels, pharmaceuticals, or food ingredients. By altering or optimizing the flow of metabolites within cells, metabolic engineers aim to improve the efficiency and yield of biochemical processes. This is done through techniques like gene editing, overexpression of enzymes, and the introduction of new pathways. Metabolic engineering has applications in industrial biotechnology, where it enables the production of biofuels, antibiotics, and biodegradable plastics, and is also crucial for improving processes in medicine, agriculture, and environmental sustainability.
D2-72;Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field that combines biology with engineering, technology, and computational science to design and construct new biological parts, devices, and systems, or to redesign existing natural biological systems for specific purposes. It involves advanced genetic engineering techniques, such as CRISPR for gene editing and synthetic DNA construction, alongside computational modeling and bioprinting. Applications span medicine, environmental science, and industry, including the development of organisms capable of producing medications, biofuels, or addressing environmental challenges. While it holds great potential, synthetic biology also raises ethical considerations regarding the unintended consequences of engineered organisms and the responsible use of this technology to ensure societal benefits.
D2-74;Greenland is the world’s largest island, located in the North Atlantic Ocean, and is an autonomous territory of Denmark. It is geographically part of North America but politically and historically connected to Europe. Greenland is known for its vast ice sheet, which covers about 80% of the island, making it a critical component of global climate systems. The island’s population is relatively small, primarily consisting of Inuit people. Its economy relies heavily on fishing, while tourism and mining are growing sectors. Greenland has significant natural resources, including minerals and oil, though environmental concerns and the impact of climate change, such as melting ice, are major issues. Greenland’s strategic location has also gained geopolitical importance in recent years.
D2-75;The Big Bang theory is an effort to explain what happened at the very beginning of our universe. Discoveries in astronomy and physics have shown beyond a reasonable doubt that our universe did in fact have a beginning. Prior to that moment there was nothing, during and after that moment there was something: our universe. The big bang theory is an effort to explain what happened during and after that moment. According to the standard theory, our universe sprang into existence as singularity around 13.7 billion years ago. What is a singularity and where does it come from? Well, Singularities are zones which defy our current understanding of physics. They are thought to exist at the core of black holes.
D2-76;Phthalates or phthalate esters, are esters of phthalic acid. They are mainly used as plasticizers, i.e., substances added to plastics to increase their flexibility, transparency, durability, and longevity. They are used primarily to soften polyvinyl chloride (PVC). While phthalates are commonly used as plasticizers, not all plasticizers are phthalates. The two terms are specific, unique, and not used interchangeably. Lower-molecular-weight phthalates are typically replaced in many products in the United States, Canada, and European Union over health concerns. They are being replaced by higher molecular-weight phthalates as well as non-phthalic plasticizers. Phthalates are commonly ingested in small quantities via the diet. There are numerous forms of phthalates not regulated by governments. One of the most  known phtalates is bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate.
D2-79;Greenland is as old as the rest of the earth. And it has no other name than Grønland or Grœnland both of which translate and even sound close to Greenland. The very first humans there were Vikings or Norse, which as government evolved became Denmark. Norway and Denmark, Iceland and Faroe Islands, even areas of England and Scotland ruled by Vikings came under a united Denmark. The story is Ingólgur Arnason wanted to discourage more people coming so named his discovery Iceland, but Eric the Red wanting to encourage settlers named his discovery Greenland although Greenland is more appropriate for Iceland and Iceland more appropriate for Greenland. Just consider them early examples of 5th Avenue Advertizing.
D2-8;Fossils appear to have directly contributed to the mythology of many civilizations, including the ancient Greeks. Classical Greek historian Herodotos wrote of an area near Hyperborea where gryphons protected golden treasure. There was indeed gold mining in that approximate region, where beaked Protoceratops skulls were common as fossils. A later Greek scholar, Aristotle, eventually realized that fossil seashells from rocks were similar to those found on the beach, indicating the fossils were once living animals.  He had previously explained them in terms of vaporous exhalations,  which Persian polymath Avicenna modified into the theory of petrifying fluids (succus lapidificatus). Recognition of fossil seashells as originating in the sea was built upon in the 14th century by Albert of Saxon.
D2-81;Educational robotics has a wide range of applications aimed at enhancing learning experiences and developing essential skills in students. One of its primary uses is to teach STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) concepts, providing hands-on learning through building, programming, and interacting with robots. It encourages critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. Robotics also supports the development of coding and computational thinking, as students learn to program robots to perform tasks and solve challenges. Furthermore, educational robotics promotes collaboration and teamwork, as many projects involve group work. In addition to its academic benefits, it can also be used to teach engineering principles, mechanical design, and mathematics in a practical, engaging way. Additionally, robotics fosters 21st-century skills like adaptability, perseverance, and communication.
D2-83;Metabolic engineering is a multidisciplinary field that applies principles of genetic engineering to modify cellular metabolism. Its goals encompass several key objectives: Production Optimization -  The fundamental aim of metabolic engineering is to mathematically model metabolic networks, calculate yields of useful products, and identify constraints in these networks. By applying genetic engineering techniques to modify these networks, researchers seek to increase product formation and overall process efficiency. Creating Industrial Cell Factories A primary purpose is to develop cell factories capable of producing cost-effective molecules at industrial scale. This involves optimizing existing biochemical pathways or introducing new pathway components, most commonly in bacteria, yeast, or plantsProcess Improvement.
D2-84;Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of ancient life, offering critical insights into Earth's history and evolution. They provide evidence of extinct species, helping scientists reconstruct past ecosystems and understand how life has changed over millions of years. Fossils reveal how species adapted, evolved, or became extinct, shedding light on the processes of natural selection and environmental changes. Additionally, they are used to date rock layers and determine the age of geological formations, aiding in the study of Earth's geologic timeline. Fossils also provide clues about ancient climates and environmental conditions, helping researchers understand past climate changes and their impacts. By studying fossils, we gain a deeper understanding of life's diversity, the history of our planet.
D2-86;Robotic education is nothing but the Hybrid Education that is provided to students, education when integrated with technology and coding is called as Robotic education. Robotic education is far better than the traditional educational system because of it instructional based teaching. Coding is not preparing an application, it is just understanding the instructions in a sequence and then execution them in a way we need the result. Coding allows the users to create something, traditional education is all about learning that is there in book, where creativity, critical thinking, programming is neglected. As robotic education is based on algorithm (set of programmed instructions to execute in sequence) it triggers students to go one step ahead.
D2-87;Join any group of distance educators today and the chances are you will hear talk of exponential expansion of distance education when the information superhighways come into being, within a decade. This might be called the Big Bang theory of distance education. You will hear enthusiastic talk about two-way communication (at last) between teacher and student, replacing the old one-way systems of print, radio and television. At last, students everywhere will be able to explore massive knowledge stores. You may also hear gloomy comments about limited access, costs and the dangers of technological determinism. You may even hear critics who seriously decry the commodification of knowledge represented by distance education.
D2-89;Greenland, the world's largest island that isn't a continent, covers 836,330 square miles in the North Atlantic, with approximately 80% of its surface covered by ice. An autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, Greenland has a population of about 56,000, predominantly Inuit. The capital, Nuuk, houses roughly one-third of its inhabitants. Despite its name, most of Greenland experiences Arctic conditions with limited vegetation. Its economy relies on fishing, tourism, and substantial mineral resources, including rare earth elements becoming increasingly valuable due to climate change. Greenlandic culture blends traditional Inuit practices with Scandinavian influences. Climate change poses significant challenges as the melting ice sheet contributes to global sea level rise while simultaneously opening new economic opportunities through increased resource accessibility.
D2-91;The Big Bang theory is the leading explanation for the origin of the universe. It posits that the universe began approximately 13.8 billion years ago from an extremely hot, dense state known as a singularity. This singularity then rapidly expanded in a process called cosmic inflation, causing space itself to stretch exponentially in a fraction of a second. As the universe expanded, it began to cool, allowing matter to form, leading to the creation of atoms, stars, galaxies, and eventually the structure of the universe we observe today. Key evidence supporting the Big Bang theory includes the cosmic microwave background radiation (a faint glow left over from the early universe), the abundance of light elements like hydrogen and helium.
D2-93;Metabolic engineering is not another form of classic manipulation of intermediary metabolism, rather, it is the purposeful design of metabolic networks. The metabolic engineering approach examines biochemical reactions in their entirety, rather than individually, and is concerned with the construction of novel pathways, the thermodynamic feasibility of pathways, and the location of limiting branch-point(s) and enzymatic reaction(s) in a reaction network. The ultimate goal is the construction of strains with superior yield and productivity obtained through a convergent evolutionary process. Progress has been made toward this objective within the framework of Metabolic Control Analysis through the development of methodologies for the experimental determination of elasticities and flux control coefficients.
D2-94;Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field that combines principles from biology, engineering, and computer science to design and construct new biological parts, systems, and organisms or to re-engineer existing biological systems for specific purposes. It involves creating synthetic genetic circuits, modifying genomes, or designing artificial enzymes to carry out tasks that natural organisms cannot. The goal of synthetic biology is to apply engineering principles to biology, enabling the synthesis of novel compounds, the production of biofuels, the development of new therapeutics, and innovations in environmental sustainability. It has vast potential for applications in medicine, agriculture, energy, and biotechnology, but also raises important ethical and safety considerations.
D2-96;Though a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with the European kingdoms of Norway and Denmark for more than a millennium, beginning in 986.[19] Greenland has been inhabited at intervals over at least the last 4,500 years by circumpolar peoples whose forebears migrated there from what is now Canada.[20][21] Norsemen from Norway settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century (having previously settled Iceland), and their descendants lived in Greenland for 400 years until disappearing in the late 15th century. The 13th century saw the arrival of Inuit.
D2-97;There has been a steady increase in the number of studies investigating educational robotics and its impact on academic and social skills of young learners. Educational robots are used both in and out of school environments to enhance K–12 students’ interest, engagement, and academic achievement in various fields of STEM education. Some prior studies show evidence for the general benefits of educational robotics as being effective in providing impactful learning experiences. However, there appears to be a need to determine the specific benefits which have been achieved through robotics implementation in K–12 formal and informal learning settings. In this study, we present a systematic review of the literature on K–12 educational robotics.
D2-98;Plasticizers like phthalates were thought to be mainly hormone disruptors. They caused fertility problems and adverse developmental effects. Surprisingly, since the 2000s researchers noted that they were instrumental in causing obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Another key point, phthalates can be absorbed through the skin, ingested by mouth or inhaled. In order to understand how phthalates cause cardiovascular disease, we need to investigate the effects of phthalates on fatty tissue. Phthalates have a negative effect on fatty tissue that leads to adipose tissue dysfunction. Fat cells develop out of adipose stem cells committing themselves and maturing into fatty cells that can store lipids. This process has the name adipogenesis.
D2-99;The main causes of lung cancer are multifaceted and involve a combination of lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors. The most significant risk factor is smoking, including both active smoking and secondhand exposure. Cigarettes release numerous harmful chemicals that damage lung cells over time, increasing the likelihood of cancer development. While not everyone who smokes develops lung cancer, the risk is considerably higher for smokers compared to non-smokers. Radon, a radioactive gas found in certain soil types, is another major contributor. It can accumulate in homes and buildings, posing a long-term health risk if exposure levels are high. Outdoor and indoor air pollution, such as emissions from vehicles and industrial activities, as well as cooking fumes from coal or wood.
