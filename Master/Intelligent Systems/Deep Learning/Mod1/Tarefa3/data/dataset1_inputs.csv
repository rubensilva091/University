D1-1	The cell cycle, or cell-division cycle, is the sequential series of events that take place in a cell that causes it to divide into two daughter cells. These events include the growth of the cell, duplication of its DNA (DNA replication) and some of its organelles, and subsequently the partitioning of its cytoplasm, chromosomes and other components into two daughter cells in a process called cell division. In eukaryotic cells (having a cell nucleus) including animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells, the cell cycle is divided into two main stages: interphase, and the M phase that includes mitosis and cytokinesis.
D1-2	The cell cycle is the process by which a cell grows, duplicates its DNA, and divides into two daughter cells. It is essential for growth, tissue repair, and reproduction. The cycle consists of four main phases. In G₁ phase, the cell grows, produces proteins, and prepares for DNA replication. During the S phase, DNA is replicated to ensure that each daughter cell receives an identical copy. The G2 phase follows, where the cell continues growing and checks for DNA damage before proceeding to division. Finally, in the M phase, the cell undergoes mitosis, where chromosomes are separated, and cytokinesis, where the cytoplasm splits.
D1-3	Photons, in many atomic models in physics, are particles which transmit light. In other words, light is carried over space by photons. Photon is an elementary particle that is its own antiparticle. In quantum mechanics each photon has a characteristic quantum of energy that depends on frequency: A photon associated with light at a higher frequency will have more energy (and be associated with light at a shorter wavelength).Photons have a rest mass of 0 (zero). However, Einstein's theory of relativity says that they do have a certain amount of momentum. Before the photon got its name, Einstein revived the proposal that light is separate pieces of energy (particles). These particles came to be known as photons.
D1-4	A photon is a fundamental particle of light and other electromagnetic radiation. It has no mass, no electric charge, and always moves at the speed of light (299,792,458 m/s in a vacuum). Photons carry energy and momentum, which depend on their wavelength or frequency. Higher frequency photons (like X-rays) have more energy, while lower frequency photons (like radio waves) have less. Their energy is given by Planck’s equation:E = h f, where E is energy, h is Planck’s constant, and f is frequency.Photons behave as both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), meaning they can interfere, diffract, and be absorbed/emitted like particles. They are responsible for vision, photosynthesis, solar power, and many quantum phenomena.
D1-5	According to the theory of plate tectonics, Earth's lithosphere, its rigid outer shell, is broken into sixteen larger and several smaller plates. These move continuously at a slow pace, due to convection in the underlying ductile mantle, and most volcanic activity on Earth takes place along plate boundaries, where plates are converging (and lithosphere is being destroyed) or are diverging (and new lithosphere is being created). During the development of geological theory, certain concepts that allowed the grouping of volcanoes in time, place, structure and composition have developed that ultimately have had to be explained in the theory of plate tectonics.
D1-6	The theory of plate tectonics explains that Earth’s lithosphere is divided into moving plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. These movements shape the planet, causing earthquakes, volcanic activity, and mountain formation. The theory builds on continental drift, proposed by Alfred Wegener, and is supported by evidence from seafloor spreading, fossil distribution, and geological formations. Plates move apart at divergent boundaries, collide at convergent boundaries, and slide past each other at transform boundaries. Their movement is driven by mantle convection, gravity, and Earth’s rotation, constantly reshaping the surface. This theory is essential for understanding natural disasters and the geological evolution of continents.
D1-7	Thalidomide is a pharmaceutical drug, first prepared in 1957 in Germany, prescribed for treating morning sickness in pregnant women. The drug was discovered to be teratogenic, causing serious genetic damage to early embryonic growth and development, leading to limb deformation in babies. Several proposed mechanisms of teratogenicity involve different biological functions for the (R)- and (S)-thalidomide enantiomers.In the human body, however, thalidomide undergoes racemization: even if only one of the two enantiomers is administered as a drug, the other enantiomer is produced as a result of metabolism. Thalidomide is currently used for the treatment of other diseases, notably cancer and leprosy. Strict regulations and controls have been implemented to avoid its use by pregnant women and prevent developmental deformities.
D1-8	Thalidomide is a drug that was first developed in the 1950s as a sedative and later prescribed to pregnant women for morning sickness. However, it caused severe birth defects, including missing or malformed limbs, when taken during pregnancy. The tragedy affected thousands of babies and led to stricter drug regulations worldwide. Despite its harmful past, thalidomide was later found to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Today, it is used under strict controls to treat multiple myeloma, leprosy-related inflammation, and some autoimmune diseases. Due to its risks, it is only prescribed under a controlled program to prevent use during pregnancy. Its history remains a major lesson in pharmaceutical safety.
D1-9	Kepler published his first two laws about planetary motion in 1609, having found them by analyzing the astronomical observations of Tycho Brahe.Kepler's third law was published in 1619. Kepler had believed in the Copernican model of the Solar System, which called for circular orbits, but he could not reconcile Brahe's highly precise observations with a circular fit to Mars' orbit – Mars coincidentally having the highest eccentricity of all planets except Mercury. His first law reflected this discovery. In 1621, Kepler noted that his third law applies to the four brightest moons of Jupiter. Godefroy Wendelin also made this observation in 1643.
D1-10	Kepler’s laws of planetary motion are three fundamental principles that describe the motion of planets around the Sun. These laws were formulated by the German astronomer Johannes Kepler in the early 17th century, building on the detailed observations of the astronomer Tycho Brahe. Kepler’s work came at a time when the heliocentric model (Sun-centered solar system) proposed by Copernicus was still controversial. Kepler initially struggled with the Copernican model, but after inheriting Brahe’s precise astronomical data, he was able to make groundbreaking discoveries. Kepler’s first law, the Law of Ellipses, stated that planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus. The second, the Law of Equal Areas, explained that planets sweep out equal areas in equal times.
D1-11	The basic idea of biological evolution is that populations and species of organisms change over time. Today, when we think of evolution, we are likely to link this idea with one specific person: the British naturalist Charles Darwin. In the 1850s, Darwin wrote an influential and controversial book called On the Origin of Species. In it, he proposed that species evolve (or, as he put it, undergo "descent with modification"), and that all living things can trace their descent to a common ancestor. Darwin also suggested a mechanism for evolution: natural selection, in which heritable traits that help organisms survive and reproduce become more common in a population over time.
D1-12	Biological evolution, according to Charles Darwin, refers to the process by which species of organisms change over time through variations in traits that are passed down from one generation to the next. Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection suggests that individuals within a species show variation in their characteristics. These variations can affect their ability to survive and reproduce in their environment. Those individuals with traits that give them a survival or reproductive advantage are more likely to pass those traits on to their offspring, while less advantageous traits are gradually eliminated. Over long periods, this process leads to the accumulation of beneficial traits in the population, resulting in the adaptation of species to their environment. 
D1-13	Stoichiometry rests upon the very basic laws that help to understand it better, i.e., law of conservation of mass, the law of definite proportions (i.e., the law of constant composition), the law of multiple proportions and the law of reciprocal proportions. In general, chemical reactions combine in definite ratios of chemicals. Since chemical reactions can neither create nor destroy matter, nor transmute one element into another, the amount of each element must be the same throughout the overall reaction. For example, the number of atoms of a given element X on the reactant side must equal the number of atoms of that element on the product side, whether or not all of those atoms are actually involved in a reaction.
D1-14	Stoichiometry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It is based on the concept that matter is conserved during a reaction, meaning the quantity of reactants used equals the quantity of products formed. Stoichiometry involves using balanced chemical equations to determine the molar ratios between substances, allowing the calculation of how much of each reactant is needed and how much product will be formed. This includes conversions between moles, mass, and volume. Stoichiometric calculations are essential for understanding reaction yields, determining the limiting reactant, and ensuring efficient use of materials in chemical processes.
D1-15	General relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Einstein in the years 1907–1915. The development of general relativity began with the equivalence principle, under which the states of accelerated motion and being at rest in a gravitational field (for example, when standing on the surface of the Earth) are physically identical. The upshot of this is that free fall is inertial motion: an object in free fall is falling because that is how objects move when there is no force being exerted on them, instead of this being due to the force of gravity as is the case in classical mechanics. 
D1-16	General relativity, also known as the general theory of relativity, is a geometric theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915. It provides a unified description of gravity as a property of spacetime, which is a four-dimensional continuum combining space and time. The theory posits that massive objects cause a curvature in spacetime, and this curvature influences the motion of objects, effectively manifesting as gravity. Einstein developed general relativity to address limitations in Newton's law of universal gravitation, particularly in explaining anomalies like the precession of Mercury's orbit. The theory has been extensively tested and confirmed through observations of gravitational waves, the bending of light around massive objects, and the behavior of objects in strong gravitational fields
D1-17	The recommended number of eggs to consume per week varies depending on several factors, including individual health, dietary preferences, and overall dietary patterns. It's important to note that while eggs are a nutritious food, they are also relatively high in dietary cholesterol. According to general guidelines, including those provided by the American Heart Association and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, consuming up to seven eggs per week is considered reasonable and can be part of a healthy diet for most people. However, it's important to consider the overall context of your diet, including other sources of cholesterol and saturated fat, as well as your individual health goals and any specific dietary restrictions or considerations you may have.
D1-18	The question of how many eggs one should eat per day is often debated due to concerns about cholesterol and cardiovascular health. Current research suggests that consuming up to three eggs per day can be part of a healthy diet for most people, particularly young, healthy adults. Consuming up to three eggs per day has been shown to increase HDL (good) cholesterol and improve the LDL/HDL ratio, which are favorable changes for cardiovascular health. For most healthy individuals, consuming up to three eggs per day can be beneficial, improving cholesterol profiles and providing essential nutrients without increasing cardiovascular risk. However, individuals with specific health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, should consider their overall dietary patterns.
D1-19	There seems to be some merit to having a single daily glass of red wine, it seems to have something called resveratrol, which acts as an antioxidant and is thought to be good for your heart. Additionally, Italian researchers found that moderate beer drinkers had a 42 percent lower risk of heart disease compared to non-drinkers. For maximum protection, keep your consumption to one pint—at around 5 percent alcohol by volume—a day, the researchers say. Basically, alcohol, in moderation, appears to lower risks of heart and other cardiovascular disease.But this is in moderation, mind you. Just as with everything else, the only difference between medicine and poison is the dosage. A beer a day is good; twelve is not.
D1-20	No level of alcohol consumption is considered entirely safe for health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), even low levels of alcohol use can increase the risk of certain cancers and other health problems. While some guidelines suggest limits to reduce risks, these guidelines are based on minimizing risk rather than ensuring safety. Recent research indicates that even moderate drinking may increase the risk of chronic diseases and premature death compared to abstaining. Therefore, the safest approach is to avoid alcohol altogether. Alcohol consumption significantly impacts mental health, often exacerbating existing conditions and contributing to new ones. Alcohol initially acts as a depressant, reducing inhibitions and creating a temporary sense of relaxation or confidence.
D1-21	There are three major compounds of life: proteins; lipids and carbohydrates. The perception of sweet taste, mainly associated with advantageous food, has had an important evolutionary influence on different physiological regulation mechanisms. During human development, sugar was always luxury. In 1885 Constantin Fahlberg produced the first artificial sweetener, saccharin, and the scientific establishment was surprised by its extreme sweetness. Significant to this discovery was the fact that sweet taste became affordable to poor people. Following the commercial success of artificial sweeteners, a battle between the sugar and sweetener industries began. Saccharin was claimed to be carcinogenic in rats. However, it was later shown that saccharin is neither toxic nor carcinogenic in normal amounts, yet its reputation remains tarnished.
D1-22	Artificial sweeteners are low- or zero-calorie sugar substitutes used to sweeten foods and beverages without the added calories of sugar. Common examples include aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, and stevia (a natural alternative). They are widely used in diet sodas, sugar-free gum, and diabetic-friendly products. While they provide sweetness without spiking blood sugar levels, they remain controversial. Studies show they are safe in moderation, but concerns exist about potential long-term effects on gut health and metabolism. Some people experience sensitivity to specific sweeteners. Ultimately, artificial sweeteners can be helpful for reducing calorie intake, but their impact varies widely from person to person.
D1-23	Recent findings on the ecology, etiology and pathology of coral pathogens, host resistance mechanisms, previously unknown disease/syndromes and the global nature of coral reef diseases have increased our concern about the health and future of coral reef communities. Much of what has been discovered in the past 4 years is presented in this special issue. Among the significant findings, the role that various Vibrio species play in coral disease and health, the composition of the ‘normal microbiota’ of corals, and the possible role of viruses in the disease process are important additions to our knowledge.  reefs and a major cause of reef deterioration.
D1-24	Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse and vital ecosystems on the planet, supporting millions of marine species and providing essential services like coastal protection and livelihoods for humans. However, their health is rapidly declining due to climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing, and pollution. Rising sea temperatures cause coral bleaching, where corals expel the algae they depend on for energy, often leading to mass die-offs. Ocean acidification, driven by increased CO₂ absorption, weakens coral skeletons, further threatening reef stability. The future of coral reefs depends on urgent conservation efforts. Strategies like reducing carbon emissions, establishing marine protected areas, and coral restoration projects (e.g., coral farming) offer hope. Research into resilient coral species and reef rehabilitation techniques is also promising. 
D1-25	Although the earliest life seems to have arisen quite soon in Earth’s history, less than 800 million years after its formation, simple forms continued for 1.6 billion years until the multicellular Francevillian biota developed and quickly died out about 2.1 billion years ago. After that, although multicellular forms were in existence from about 1.7 billion years ago, it was not until the Cambrian ‘explosion’ from 540–500 million years ago that multicellular life expanded and prospered. This is essentially what we know. But fossilisation is rare and early life has resulted in tiny traces  difficult to interpret. At present there are believed to be about one trillion species on Earth, less than one per cent of those which have ever lived.
D1-26	The question of how life appeared on Earth is one of science’s greatest mysteries. While there is no definitive answer, scientists propose various theories based on evidence and hypotheses.VPrimordial Soup Theory: This idea suggests that life began in a "soup" of organic molecules in early Earth's oceans. Energy from lightning, volcanic activity, or UV radiation may have triggered chemical reactions, forming basic building blocks of life like amino acids and nucleotides. Experiments like the 1953 Miller-Urey experiment support this theory by showing that organic molecules can form under simulated early Earth conditions. Hydrothermal Vent Hypothesis: Some researchers believe life began near deep-sea hydrothermal vents, where hot, mineral-rich water provided the energy and raw materials for life.
D1-27	We investigate the problem about the reason for the significant sub-centurial (50-55 and 60-65 yr) and quasi-centurial (120-130 yr) climatic oscillations. The 50-55 and 60-65 yr cycles are clearly detectable in numerous global and regional climatic parameters, i.e. in the temperatures of the Northern Hemisphere and World Ocean surface, in the tree rings widths, in the atmosphere concentration of CO2, etc. Searching for analogues of these cycles in the solar activity we study the connections between various types of solar, geophysical and climatic cycles. In this Paper I we analyze time series of residual variations of the Northern Hemisphere (AD 1610-1979) and World Ocean surface (AD 18561995) temperatures in respect to the corresponding regression models "sunspot activity – temperature".
D1-28	Significant climatic oscillations on sub-centurial (50–55 years, 60–65 years) and quasi-centurial (120–130 years) timescales are thought to arise from natural variability in Earth's climate system, driven by a combination of internal processes and external forcing mechanisms. The causes of these oscillations include: Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are large-scale oceanic patterns of variability that operate on multidecadal timescales (50–70 years). These affect global heat distribution, weather patterns, and long-term climate trends. Solar Variability Variations in solar activity, such as the Gleissberg Cycle (~80–120 years), impact Earth's climate. Changes in solar irradiance affect atmospheric dynamics, ocean circulation, and surface temperatures.
D1-29	The COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan, central China’s Hubei Province, but that doesn’t mean the novel coronavirus had originated from China. It may have originated from somewhere else. To determine the origin of an unknown virus requires scientific, meticulous research, instead of random speculation. The source of the virus is a scientific issue and requires a professional investigation. Without evidence supported by data or research, no one can claim where it had originated from. Connecting a virus with a region may cause xenophobic behavior. The pandemic influenza of 2009 originated in North America, but it was not called the “North America flu.” That is why the World Health Organization named the novel coronavirus “COVID-19,” which avoids stigmatizing a particularly region.
D1-30	The origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, remains uncertain, with two main theories under discussion. The dominant hypothesis suggests a natural origin through zoonotic spillover, where the virus jumped from bats, its likely reservoir, to humans, possibly via an intermediate species such as pangolins. This theory links the early outbreak to a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where live wild animals were sold. Another theory suggests an accidental leak from a laboratory, like the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies bat coronaviruses, though no direct evidence supports this claim. While most scientists favor the natural origin hypothesis, limited data and restricted early access make the exact source of the virus difficult to confirm.
