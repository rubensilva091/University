D2-1;The Solar System faces a dramatic future over billions of years. In approximately 5-7 billion years, our Sun will exhaust its hydrogen fuel and expand into a red giant, likely engulfing Mercury and Venus. Earth may either be consumed or rendered uninhabitable as oceans and atmosphere evaporate. The outer planets will survive but experience significant changes in temperature and orbital dynamics. Eventually, the Sun will shed its outer layers, creating a planetary nebula while its core collapses into a white dwarf star.
This white dwarf will slowly cool over trillions of years, leaving our former solar neighborhood incredibly dim. Any surviving planets will orbit in perpetual darkness, frozen and lifeless.
D2-2;Spermidine is an aliphatic polyamine. Spermidine synthase (SPDS) catalyzes its formation from putrescine. It is a precursor to other polyamines, such as spermine and its structural isomer thermospermine. Spermidine synchronizes an array of biological processes, (such as Ca2+, Na+, K+ -ATPase) thus maintaining membrane potential and controlling intracellular pH and volume. Spermidine regulates biological processes, such as Ca2+ influx by glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor), which has been associated with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cGMP/PKG pathway activation and a decrease of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in cerebral cortex synaptosomes. Spermidine is a longevity agent in mammals due to various mechanisms of action, which are just beginning to be understood. 
D2-3;The feasibility of extraterrestrial life is a subject of intense scientific interest, supported by discoveries in astrobiology, planetary science, and extremophile research. While no direct evidence has been found, several factors suggest its plausibility. Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered, some located in the habitable zone where liquid water could exist, a key ingredient for life as we know it. The discovery of extremophiles on Earth, thriving in extreme conditions such as deep-sea vents and frozen tundras, suggests that life could also adapt to harsh extraterrestrial environments like those on Mars, Europa, or Enceladus. Additionally, complex organic molecules, the building blocks of life, have been detected in meteorites, comets, and interstellar clouds, indicating that life’s fundamental chemistry is widespread.
D2-4;Many cross sectional and prospective studies have confirmed the association between obesity and type 2 diabetes. Most people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese: more than 85% of people with type 2 diabetes in southeast Scotland in 2005 had a body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared) of over 25. Recent evidence indicates that high waist circumference may be an even better indicator than body mass index (BMI) of increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The risk of developing diabetes over a 14 year follow-up period in the nurses' health study was 49 times higher among women whose baseline BMI was >35 than among women whose baseline BMI was <22.
D2-5;There were observations of spectral lines. That means there are distinct levels where electrons stay. Classical mechanics does not allow such distinctive levels for electrons to stay. For this new approach is needed. In classical mechanics, energy remains constant. This must be building block. It is my interpretation. Then. he thought that the electrons obey some function distribution which give distinctive levels. This is possible for sin and cos functions. So the electrons should obey sin and cos functions and also obey total energy conservation i.e to start with kinetic energy + potential energy = constant. Potential energy and sin function is not problem, because we know pendulum oscillations. How to modify kinetic energy to give sine function.
D2-6;The active quest for extra-solar planets has opened a new chapter in the book of the search for extra-terrestrial life. This was already an active field of science with the exploration of the Solar System by means of space probes, which gave rise to a ‘space age’ from 1957 when Sputnik-1, the first Earth-orbiting artificial satellite, was launched. Current technology allows us to land a robotic chemistry laboratory on other Solar System bodies, or return samples to Earth, the latter coming with the advantage of being able to adapt analysis strategies to unexpected findings. Based on our current understanding, Mars, Europa, Enceladus and, if we consider life based on a liquid other than water, Titan are the most promising places.
D2-7;Spermidine synthases are essential enzymes that function as aminopropyltransferases, transferring aminopropyl groups from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine to amine acceptors, forming polyamines. Structurally, these enzymes contain a SAM-MT fold and typically form homodimers. The mechanism follows an SN2 reaction pathway where spermidine synthase (SPDS) catalyzes the formation of spermidine from putrescine The human spermidine synthase is highly specific for putrescine as the amine acceptor. Crystal structures have been solved at high resolution, including the putrescine aminopropyltransferase from Thermotoga maritima at 1.5 Å . These structural studies, combined with biochemical analyses of enzymes from various organisms, have provided detailed insights into the catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of this important class of enzymes.
D2-8;Fossils appear to have directly contributed to the mythology of many civilizations, including the ancient Greeks. Classical Greek historian Herodotos wrote of an area near Hyperborea where gryphons protected golden treasure. There was indeed gold mining in that approximate region, where beaked Protoceratops skulls were common as fossils. A later Greek scholar, Aristotle, eventually realized that fossil seashells from rocks were similar to those found on the beach, indicating the fossils were once living animals.  He had previously explained them in terms of vaporous exhalations,  which Persian polymath Avicenna modified into the theory of petrifying fluids (succus lapidificatus). Recognition of fossil seashells as originating in the sea was built upon in the 14th century by Albert of Saxon.
D2-9;"There are two types of diabetes: type 1, where your body is unable to make insulin, and type 2, where your body is unable to properly use the insulin it makes. When your body doesn't have enough insulin, you can't move glucose from your blood to the cells, and then you don't get the nutrients your body needs for energy. Type 2 diabetes is also often genetic, as in my case. The fact that there's no break from the disease. I have diabetes 24/7, 365 days a year. Managing what I eat is a constant challenge, especially when there are potato chips nearby. And honestly, I hate cooking and I'm always looking for easy recipes."
D2-10;The origin of angiosperms (flowering plants) represents what Charles Darwin famously called an ""abominable mystery"" due to their apparent sudden appearance and rapid diversification in the fossil record. Modern research combines multiple lines of evidence to address this evolutionary puzzle. The fossil record shows unequivocal angiosperm evidence beginning in the Early Cretaceous (approximately 125-130 million years ago), with remarkably diverse forms appearing within 20-30 million years. Key early fossils include Archaefructus and Montsechia, with water lily relatives among the earliest documented flowering plants. Molecular evidence, however, suggests an earlier origin than fossils indicate. DNA-based phylogenies identify Amborella, water lilies, and Austrobaileyales as the earliest-diverging lineages. Molecular clock analyses often place angiosperm origins in the Jurassic period (145-201 million years ago).
D2-11;These nutrients are needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy. A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone deformities such as rickets in children, and bone pain caused by a condition called osteomalacia in adults. Government advice is that everyone should consider taking a daily vitamin D supplement during the autumn and winter. People at high risk of not getting enough vitamin D, all children aged 1 to 4, and all babies (unless they're having more than 500ml of infant formula a day) should take a daily supplement throughout the year. There have been some reports about vitamin D reducing the risk of coronavirus (COVID-19).
D2-12;Vitamin D is essential for maintaining healthy bones, teeth, and immune function, primarily by regulating calcium and phosphorus levels in the body. Humans can synthesize vitamin D through skin exposure to sunlight (UVB rays), but factors like limited sun exposure, darker skin, age, and geographic location can reduce production. The recommended daily intake varies by age and health status. For most adults, 600-800 IU (15-20 µg) per day is sufficient, though some individuals may require higher doses, especially if deficient. Dietary sources include fatty fish, fortified foods, and supplements. Deficiency can lead to rickets in children, osteomalacia in adults, and weakened immunity, making adequate vitamin D intake crucial for overall health and well-being. Regular checks can ensure optimal levels.
D2-13;Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the center of the protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion.As helium accumulates at its core, the Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved: the thermal pressure counterbalancing the force of gravity. At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star. Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space.
D2-14;Molecular data on relationships within angiosperms confirm the view that their increasing morphological diversity through the Cretaceous reflected their evolutionary radiation. Despite the early appearance of aquatics and groups with simple flowers, the record is consistent with inferences from molecular trees that the first angiosperms were woody plants with pinnately veined leaves, multiparted flowers, uniovulate ascidiate carpels, and columellar monosulcate pollen. Molecular data appear to refute the hypothesis based on morphology that angiosperms and Gnetales are closest living relatives. Morphological analyses of living and fossil seed plants that assume molecular relationships identify glossopterids, Bennettitales, and Caytonia as angiosperm relatives; these results are consistent with proposed homologies between the cupule of glossopterids and Caytonia and the angiosperm bitegmic ovule.
D2-15;There are an estimated 2 trillion galaxies in the known Universe, some will hold millions and others will hold billions of stars. Most of the stars will have various amounts of planets in orbit around them and trillions of those planets will be in the Goldilocks Zone, which is an area in space that has the right conditions for liquid water to exist. So the logical thing you might say is “There must be life on some of them”. Maybe some other intelligent life form on a faraway world is asking that same question. If we are alone that would make us more special and unique than we could ever imagine.
D2-16;Type 2 diabetes rates have risen dramatically worldwide since the 1980s, constituting a global health crisis. The prevalence has more than doubled over the past three decades, increasing from approximately 108 million adults in 1980 to over 537 million (10.5% of global adult population) by 2021. This surge has been particularly pronounced in middle-income countries experiencing rapid urbanization, with Pacific Islands and Middle Eastern nations showing the highest prevalence rates, while China and India have the largest absolute numbers. Key drivers include rising obesity rates, increasingly sedentary lifestyles, Westernization of diets, aging populations, and improved detection methods. While some high-income countries have shown signs of stabilization recently, global projections remain concerning, with cases expected to reach 783 million by 2045.
D2-17;Quarks and gluons are both fundamental particles in the Standard Model of particle physics, but they have distinct roles. Quarks are the building blocks of matter, combining to form protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. They come in six flavors: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Quarks have fractional electric charges and interact via the strong nuclear force, which holds them together inside protons and neutrons. Gluons, on the other hand, are force carrier particles responsible for transmitting the strong nuclear force between quarks. Unlike quarks, gluons have no mass and no electric charge, but they do carry a property called color charge, which allows them to bind quarks together through a phenomenon known as color confinement.
D2-18;Insects as food or edible insects are insect species used for human consumption. Over 2 billion people are estimated to eat insects on a daily basis. Globally, more than 2,000 insect species are considered edible, though far fewer are discussed for industrialized mass production and regionally authorized for use in food. Many insects are highly nutritious, though nutritional content depends on species and other factors such as diet and age. Insects offer a wide variety of flavors and are commonly consumed whole or pulverized for use in dishes and processed food products such as burger patties, pasta, or snacks. Like other foods, there can be risks associated with consuming insects, such as allergic reactions.
D2-19;Schrödinger's cat is a famous thought experiment proposed by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935 to illustrate the apparent paradoxes of quantum mechanics. It involves a hypothetical scenario where a cat is placed in a sealed box with a radioactive atom, a Geiger counter, and a poison mechanism. If the radioactive atom decays (a random quantum event), the poison is released, killing the cat. According to quantum mechanics, until observed, the radioactive atom exists in a superposition of both decayed and undecayed states. This implies the cat would be simultaneously both alive and dead until someone opens the box to check. The experiment highlights the disconnect between quantum mechanical principles and our everyday experience of reality, challenging our understanding of observation.
D2-20;For a fossil to exist it needs to survive a long time. Many animals are active kills by predictors. In such cases one might find a few teeth but most bone and tissue is gone. In rain forests the amount of insects make finding anything unlikely. Any animal is quickly dissected. Bones often dissolve in the slightly acid rain. Good places to find fossils are hence riverbeds or banks where cold freezing water quickly kills the animal and sediments are readily available to bury the remains long enough to begin the next step in the fossilization process. Similarly lakes that break through a wall and empty might evaporate and have large amount of fish and other animals.
D2-21;The probability of extraterrestrial life existing remains one of science's great unknowns, with estimates varying widely based on different assumptions and models. While we lack direct evidence of life beyond Earth, several scientific factors inform our understanding:
The Drake Equation, formulated in 1961, attempts to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy by multiplying several probability factors. However, many of these factors remain highly uncertain. Many astrobiologists consider microbial life likely to exist elsewhere, with estimates ranging from cautious to highly optimistic. The probability of intelligent civilizations remains more speculative, with the Fermi Paradox (questioning why we haven't detected them) suggesting either rarity or communication difficulties.
D2-22;Insects can be used for food production and are already consumed in many cultures worldwide. They are a nutritious, sustainable, and environmentally friendly protein source. Edible insects such as crickets, mealworms, grasshoppers, and black soldier fly larvae are rich in protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals like iron and zinc. Compared to traditional livestock, insect farming requires less land, water, and feed, while producing lower greenhouse gas emissions. Insects can be used in whole form, ground into flours for protein bars, pasta, or baked goods, or processed into animal feed. While cultural barriers exist in some regions, the growing interest in sustainable food sources is driving research and commercial production of edible insects globally.
D2-23;Diabetes type 1 and type 2 are both chronic conditions affecting blood sugar regulation but have different causes and mechanisms. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to little or no insulin production. It usually develops in childhood or adolescence and requires lifelong insulin therapy. Type 2 diabetes is primarily caused by insulin resistance, where the body still produces insulin but cannot use it effectively. It is more common in adults and is strongly linked to obesity, diet, and lifestyle factors. Type 2 can often be managed with diet, exercise, and medication, while type 1 requires insulin replacement. Both types require careful blood sugar management to prevent complications.
D2-24;Entomophagy—the practice of consuming insects as food—has deep historical roots in many cultures worldwide, with approximately 2 billion people regularly incorporating insects into their diets. While Western societies have traditionally viewed insects with disgust, growing environmental and food security concerns have sparked renewed interest in this protein source. Nutritionally, edible insects offer impressive benefits. Most species provide complete proteins containing all essential amino acids, often at higher concentrations than conventional meats. Many insects are rich in micronutrients like iron, zinc, and B vitamins, while containing healthy fats including omega-3 fatty acids. Cricket flour, for example, contains approximately 60-70% protein by weight, exceeding most plant and animal sources.
D2-25;Quarks and gluons are fundamental particles in the Standard Model of particle physics, both essential to our understanding of strong nuclear forces, yet they differ in several key ways. Fundamental Nature Quarks are elementary fermions that serve as the building blocks of hadrons (protons, neutrons, and other composite particles). Six flavors exist: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. In contrast, gluons are gauge bosons that mediate the strong force between quarks, similar to how photons mediate the electromagnetic force. Properties Quarks possess fractional electric charges (+2/3 or -1/3), mass, spin-1/2, and color charge. Gluons are massless, have spin-1, carry no electric charge, but uniquely possess both color and anticolor charges.
D2-26;The global increase in demand for meat and the limited land area available prompt the search for alternative protein sources. Also the sustainability of meat production has been questioned. Edible insects as an alternative protein source for human food and animal feed are interesting in terms of low greenhouse gas emissions, high feed conversion efficiency, low land use, and their ability to transform low value organic side streams into high value protein products. More than 2000 insect species are eaten mainly in tropical regions. The role of edible insects in the livelihoods and nutrition of people in tropical countries is discussed, but this food source is threatened
D2-27;In 1802, Lamarck published Hydrogéologie, and became one of the first to use the term biology in its modern sense. In Hydrogéologie, Lamarck advocated a steady-state geology based on a strict uniformitarianism. He argued that global currents tended to flow from east to west, and continents eroded on their eastern borders, with the material carried across to be deposited on the western borders. Thus, the Earth's continents marched steadily westward around the globe. That year, he also published Recherches sur l'Organisation des Corps Vivants, in which he drew out his theory on evolution. He believed that all life was organized in a vertical chain, with gradation between the lowest forms and the highest forms of life.
D2-28;Fossils have played a significant role in shaping Greek mythology, as ancient Greeks often interpreted large, mysterious bones as evidence of mythical creatures. The discovery of massive fossils, such as those of mammoths, mastodons, and prehistoric reptiles, likely influenced myths about giants, cyclopes, and dragons. For instance, the large skulls of prehistoric elephants, which have a central nasal cavity, may have been mistaken for the skulls of one-eyed Cyclopes, reinforcing the legend of these formidable beings. Similarly, fossilized bones of large extinct animals could have inspired stories of titans and heroes slaying monstrous beasts. Greek naturalists like Herodotus and Pliny the Elder documented fossil findings, showing early attempts to explain these remains within a mythological and historical framework.
D2-29;Synthetic biology emerged as a specialized branch of bioengineering over the last 15-20 years, propelled by the technologies of DNA sequencing and DNA synthesis. The emphasis is now on characterizing molecular components and standardizing them so that they work together. Today, computer programming languages have become more abstract by building upon previous languages, making it easier and faster to create complex programs. Similarly, in the future, standardized molecular components will make biology understandable through abstraction. This will in turn make it easier to engineer new functions. Of course any biological abstraction would rely on molecular details (just like all computer code is finally executed as assembly), so studying molecular biology is very worthwhile. 
D2-30;More than 1,900 species of edible insects are consumed worldwide. However, this number continues to increase as more studies are carried out on this issue. Most of these known species are collected directly from the natural environment, but available data on the amounts of insects that are ingested worldwide are scarce. In any case, there is agreement that of the hundreds of insect species used as human food worldwide, the most common can be encompassed into four groups: beetles; ants, bees and wasps; grasshoppers and crickets and, finally, moths, caterpillars, and butterflies. According to FAO, the most consumed insects are beetles (Coleoptera, 31%), caterpillars (Lepidoptera, 18%) and bees, wasps and ants (Hymenoptera, 14%).
D2-31;Vitamin D plays a crucial role in human health, primarily regulating calcium and phosphorus absorption for bone formation and maintenance. The body produces vitamin D when skin is exposed to sunlight, but it can also be obtained through diet (fatty fish, egg yolks) and supplements. The recommended daily intake is 600-800 IU for most adults, though needs increase with age and limited sun exposure. Deficiency can lead to bone disorders like rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, muscle weakness, and potentially increased risk of certain chronic diseases. Factors affecting vitamin D status include geographical location, season, skin pigmentation, age, and dietary habits. Regular moderate sun exposure combined with dietary sources provides sufficient vitamin D for most people."
D2-32;Synthetic biology is bringing together engineers and biologists to design and build novel biomolecular components, networks and pathways, and to use these constructs to rewire and reprogram organisms. These re-engineered organisms will change our lives over the coming years, leading to cheaper drugs, 'green' means to fuel our cars and targeted therapies for attacking 'superbugs' and diseases, such as cancer. The de novo engineering of genetic circuits, biological modules and synthetic pathways is beginning to address these crucial problems and is being used in related practical applications. The circuit-like connectivity of biological parts and their ability to collectively process logical operations was first appreciated nearly 50 years ago.
D2-33;Computational systems biology is an emerging field in biological simulation that attempts to model or simulate intra- and intercellular events using data gathered from genomic, proteomic or metabolomic experiments. The need to model complex temporal and spatiotemporal processes at many different scales has led to the emergence of numerous techniques, including systems of differential equations, Petri nets, cellular automata simulators, agent-based models and pi calculus. This review provides a brief summary and an assessment of most of these approaches. It also provides examples of how these methods are being used to facilitate drug discovery and development. Systems biology is a newly emerging, multi-disciplinary field that studies the mechanisms underlying complex biological processes by treating these processes as integrated systems. 
D2-34;The main causes of lung cancer are primarily linked to smoking and environmental exposures. Tobacco smoking is the leading cause, responsible for about 85% of cases, as the harmful chemicals in smoke damage DNA in lung cells. Secondhand smoke is also a significant risk factor. Another major cause is exposure to radon gas, a naturally occurring radioactive substance that can accumulate in buildings. Occupational exposures to substances like asbestos, arsenic, and diesel exhaust also increase the risk, particularly in certain industries. Additionally, genetic factors and family history can make some individuals more susceptible, while air pollution and poor air quality further contribute to the development of lung cancer.
D2-35;Einstein and Schrödinger exchanged significant ideas throughout their careers. Both physicists shared deep skepticism about the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, maintaining a correspondence that revealed their mutual discomfort with quantum indeterminism. Einstein's famous quote, God does not play dice with the universe, echoed Schrödinger's own reservations. Their intellectual relationship flourished through letters and occasional meetings, where they discussed unified field theory and the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics. Schrödinger's cat thought experiment partially emerged from these discussions, attempting to illustrate what both considered absurdities in quantum theory. Though they never resolved their concerns about quantum mechanics, their dialogue represented one of the most profound scientific exchanges of the 20th century, challenging mainstream quantum interpretations while searching for deeper truths.
D2-36;Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large, complex group of synthetic chemicals that have been used in consumer products worldwide since the 1950s. These compounds serve as ingredients in various everyday products, with applications ranging from industrial uses to consumer goods due to their unique water and oil-repellent properties. PFAS are often referred to as forever chemicals due to their extraordinary environmental persistence They represent persistent contaminants that are particularly challenging to address through conventional wastewater treatment processes Their persistence has made them contaminants of emerging concern in industrialized countries, where they accumulate in the environment over time. Research indicates that PFAS exposure poses significant health risks: PFAS disrupt biological membranes resulting in cellular inhibition.
D2-37;Obesity and type 2 diabetes have a close relationship. The likelihood and severity of type 2 diabetes are closely related to BMI. Obese people have a higher risk of diabetes than healthy weight people, with a threefold increase in risk for overweight people. While it is well known that body fat distribution is an important primary indicator of diabetes risk, the precise mechanism of association is unknown. It is also unknown why not all obese people develop type 2 diabetes and why not all type 2 diabetics are obese. Also obesity significantly increases your chances of developing type 2 diabetes at some point in your life. When there is an excess of fat, the tissues must process more nutrients. 
D2-38;The variation in PFAS regulatory values across the globe can be easily addressed due to the influence of multiple scientific, technical, and social factors. The varied toxicology and the insufficient definition of PFAS exposure rate are among the main factors contributing to this discrepancy. The lack of proven standard approaches for examining PFAS in surface water, groundwater, wastewater, or solids adds more technical complexity. Although it is agreed that PFASs pose potential health risks in various media, the link between the extent of PFAS exposure and the significance of PFAS risk remain among the evolving research areas. There is a growing need to address the correlation between the frequency and the likelihood of human exposure to PFAS .
D2-39;Rates of type 2 diabetes have increased markedly since 1960 in parallel with obesity. As of 2015, there were approximately 392 million people diagnosed with the disease compared to around 30 million in 1985. Typically, it begins in middle or older age, although rates of type 2 diabetes are increasing in young people. Type 2 diabetes is associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy. Diabetes was one of the first diseases ever described, dating back to an Egyptian manuscript from c. 1500 BCE. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions in 400–500 CE with type 1 associated with youth and type 2 with being overweight. The importance of insulin in the disease was determined in the 1920s
D2-40;An unexpected emergent property of a complex system may be a result of the interplay of the cause-and-effect among simpler, integrated parts (see biological organisation). Biological systems manifest many important examples of emergent properties in the complex interplay of components. Traditional study of biological systems requires reductive methods in which quantities of data are gathered by category, such as concentration over time in response to a certain stimulus. Computers are critical to analysis and modelling of these data. The goal is to create accurate real-time models of a system's response to environmental and internal stimuli, such as a model of a cancer cell in order to find weaknesses in its signalling pathways.
D2-41;Quarks are fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons, the building blocks of atomic nuclei. They are part of the Standard Model of particle physics and are classified as elementary particles, meaning they have no known substructure. Quarks come in six types, or flavors: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. They always exist in groups, held together by the strong nuclear force, which is mediated by particles called gluons. The most common quarks in nature are up and down, which combine to form protons and neutrons. Quarks have fractional electric charges and cannot exist independently outside of bound states due to a phenomenon called color confinement.
D2-42;In order to determine how much Vitamin D supplement to take, you first need to find out what your current Vitamin D level is. You determine the level of vitamin D by doing a blood test for 25 (OH) vitamin D. That’s 25 hydroxy vitamin D. Most experts agree that a level of 32 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) in the blood is optimal for bone health but no one agrees on what is optimal for immune health, heart health, cancer health and all the other important functions that vitamin D appears to have. Your skin, where vitamin D is made, has a wonderful system for making the right amount, then shutting off further production.
D2-43;Early lung cancer often has no symptoms and can only be detected by medical imaging. As the cancer progresses, most people experience nonspecific respiratory problems: coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Other symptoms depend on the location and size of the tumor. Those suspected of having lung cancer typically undergo a series of imaging tests to determine the location and extent of any tumors. Definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires a biopsy of the suspected tumor be examined by a pathologist under a microscope. . In addition to recognizing cancerous cells, a pathologist can classify the tumor according to the type of cells it originates from. 
D2-44;To further illustrate, Schrödinger described how one could, in principle, create a superposition in a large-scale system by making it dependent on a quantum particle that was in a superposition. He proposed a scenario with a cat in a closed steel chamber, wherein the cat's life or death depended on the state of a radioactive atom, whether it had decayed and emitted radiation or not. According to Schrödinger, the Copenhagen interpretation implies that the cat remains both alive and dead until the state has been observed. Schrödinger did not wish to promote the idea of dead-and-live cats as a serious possibility; on the contrary, he intended the example to illustrate the absurdity of the existing view of quantum mechanics
D2-45;Educational robotics teaches the design, analysis, application and operation of robots. Robots include articulated robots, mobile robots or autonomous vehicles. Educational robotics can be taught from elementary school to graduate programs. Robotics may also be used to motivate and facilitate the instruction other, often foundational, topics such as computer programming, artificial intelligence or engineering design. Robotics engineers design robots, maintain them, develop new applications for them, and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics. Robots have become a popular educational tool in some middle and high schools, as well as in numerous youth summer camps, raising interest in programming, artificial intelligence and robotics among students.
D2-46;Obesity is recognized as a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, though it does not directly cause the disease. The connection between these conditions is so significant that healthcare professionals have coined the term diabesity to highlight that the majority of individuals with diabetes are obese or overweight demonstrates that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases linearly with rising body mass index. This explains why the worldwide increase in obesity prevalence has led to a corresponding surge in type 2 diabetes cases globally. The relationship works through several mechanisms: excess body fat, particularly visceral fat, affects insulin sensitivity and function. Some individuals with obesity can produce more insulin without overtaxing the pancreasy.
D2-47;Systems Biology is not one thing, and is quite different to different people. In my view Systems Biology is really a modern perspective on doing basic Biology research. It is not really an applied field, intending to directly be useful for industry and make products. Instead it aims to unlock the key principles of life, which can be used to do that thereafter. However, a lot of the processes of Systems Biology involves using cutting edge tools, especially computational ones, which can give you a good handle on the process of being a data scientist, handling large amount of experimentally obtained data, processing and analyzing it to make decisions about future course of actions.
D2-48;Educational robotics represents an innovative approach to learning that combines technology with hands-on experience, offering numerous benefits for students across different age groups. Educational robotics provides a strong foundation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). As students engage with robotics, they naturally develop capabilities in these critical disciplines, preparing them for future academic and career challenges. This approach is increasingly viewed as a strategic way to introduce and incentivize students to pursue careers in STEM fields. Beyond technical knowledge, robotics education cultivates essential life skills that benefit students regardless of their eventual career path. Students working with robotics develop problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and resilience when facing challenges.
D2-49;According to Poe, the initial state of matter was a single Primorial Particle. Divine Volition, manifesting itself as a repulsive force, fragmented the Primordial Particle into atoms. Atoms spread evenly throughout space, until the repulsive force stops, and attraction appears as a reaction: then matter begins to clump together forming stars and star systems, while the material universe is drawn back together by gravity, finally collapsing and ending eventually returning to the Primordial Particle stage in order to begin the process of repulsion and attraction once again. This part of Eureka describes a Newtonian evolving universe which shares a number of properties with relativistic models, and for this reason Poe anticipates some themes of modern cosmology."
D2-50;The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury as well as Venus, and render Earth and Mars uninhabitable (possibly destroying Earth as well). Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will be ejected into space, leaving behind a dense white dwarf, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers may form a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun.
D2-51;The Big Bang theory is the predominant scientific explanation for our universe's origin, describing not an explosion but rather how the universe expanded from an initial state of extreme density and temperature approximately 13.8 billion years ago. This initial state, called a singularity, contained all matter in an incredibly hot, dense point before expansion began. Proposed by physicist Georges Lemaître in 1927, the theory is supported by multiple lines of evidence, including the cosmic microwave background radiation (essentially the Big Bang's ""afterglow"") and the abundance of light elements in the universe. Later refinements include cosmic inflation theory, suggesting that the early universe briefly expanded faster than light speed.
D2-52;Mainstream physicists treat “quarks” and “gluons” as real particles. However, the observational evidence disagrees with that conclusion. Whereas electron and protons exist for billions of years, “quarks” are only observed for less than billionths of a second. Gluons are not observed at all, but are only theorized. When “quarks” are “observed,” it is during a collision among protons and/or neutrons in an accelerator. After the collision, the “quarks” completely disappear and are never observed again. There has never been an observation of a “sea of quarks” among from which could be used to construct new protons or neutrons. “Quarks” are nothing more than debris from a collision; much like glass shards are debris from a glass striking a brick wall.
D2-53;Lavoisier's Law, formally known as the Law of Conservation of Mass, is one of the fundamental principles in chemistry established by French chemist Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century . The law states that In a closed system, matter is neither created nor destroyed during chemical reactions or physical transformations . In simpler terms, the total mass of substances present before a chemical reaction equals the total mass after the reaction, even though the substances may change form. Lavoisier demonstrated this principle through meticulous experiments where he carefully measured the mass of reactants and products. Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794), often called the father of modern chemistry, formulated this principle around 1774."
D2-54;Using the Schwinger-Dyson equations the behavior of quark and gluon propagators is studied in the Landau gauge for momenta from the deep Euclidean to the confinement regime. We find that while at short distances quarks and gluons propagate like free particles, over longer distances, of the order of a fermi, the gluon propagator is greatly enhanced as are the triple-gluon and quark-gluon couplings. These in turn suppress the propagation of massless quarks over long distances to such an extent that they have no physical particle pole, exactly as expected of a confining theory. We study the way the world changes as the number of massless flavors of quark is increased from zero. 
D2-55;In physics and chemistry, the law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter the mass of the system must remain constant over time. The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, although it may be rearranged in space, or the entities associated with it may be changed in form. For example, in chemical reactions, the mass of the chemical components before the reaction is equal to the mass of the components after the reaction. Thus, during any chemical reaction and low-energy thermodynamic processes in an isolated system, the total mass of the reactants, or starting materials, must be equal to the mass of the products.
D2-56;Metabolic engineering is a specialized field that focuses on optimizing metabolic pathways in organisms to enhance the production of desired products, such as biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals. Applications include the development of microbes or cells capable of efficiently producing high-value compounds, improving the yield and sustainability of chemical manufacturing, and enhancing the production of bio-based materials. It also plays a key role in environmental biotechnology, such as detoxifying pollutants or remediating soil and water. Additionally, metabolic engineering is used to improve agricultural crops by enhancing their nutrient content, stress tolerance, or resistance to pests. By tailoring metabolic pathways, it enables the creation of novel therapeutic agents, advanced biofuels, and sustainable industrial processes.
D2-57;In modern terms Schrodinger's hypothetical cat experiment describes the measurement problem: quantum theory describes the cat system as a combination of two possible outcomes but only one outcome is ever observed.  The experiment poses the question, when does a quantum system stop existing as a superposition of states and become one or the other? (More technically, when does the actual quantum state stop being a non-trivial linear combination of states, each of which resembles different classical states, and instead begin to have a unique classical description?) Standard microscopic quantum mechanics describes multiple possible outcomes of experiments but only one outcome is observed. The thought experiment illustrates this apparent paradox.
D2-58;The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model explaining the origin and evolution of the universe. It proposes that the universe began approximately 13.8 billion years ago as an extremely hot and dense point, which rapidly expanded in a process called inflation. As the universe expanded and cooled, fundamental particles and then atoms formed, eventually leading to the creation of stars, galaxies, and other cosmic structures. Observational evidence, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation (leftover heat from the early universe) and the abundance of light elements, strongly supports this theory. The Big Bang also explains the universe's large-scale structure and the observed redshift of distant galaxies, which indicates the ongoing expansion of space.
D2-59;Synthetic biology, which aims to design or assemble biological parts for useful applications, has emerged as a transformative field with wide-ranging implications across multiple sectors. Synthetic biology has significant medical applications, including improving drug discovery and development through rapid screening of DNA sequences, often leveraging AI and machine learning to identify promising drug candidates. The field enables production of therapeutic molecules with precise targeting and efficacy, and advances antibody and vaccine production. Researchers are engineering biological systems that could potentially treat complex diseases such as cancer. In industrial settings, synthetic biology enables the creation of ""cell factories"" that can efficiently produce valuable compounds. Applications include: Biofuel production through engineered microorganisms; Production of pharmaceuticals and biomaterials using biological systems.
D2-60;The dangers of PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, stem from their persistence in the environment and their ability to bioaccumulate in living organisms. Known as forever chemicals, PFAS do not break down easily, leading to long-term environmental contamination. They are found in products like non-stick cookware, firefighting foam, and water-repellent textiles. PFAS can enter the human body through contaminated drinking water and food, particularly in areas near industrial sites. Prolonged exposure has been linked to serious health issues, including certain cancers, hormonal disruptions, and weakened immune systems. Additionally, PFAS contribute to ecosystem harm by affecting wildlife and biodiversity. Their long-lasting nature makes them a significant environmental and public health concern, as they are challenging to eliminate.
D2-61;Aminopropyltransferases transfer aminopropyl groups from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine to amine acceptors, forming polyamines. Structural and biochemical studies have been carried out with the human spermidine synthase, which is highly specific for putrescine as the amine acceptor, and the Thermotoga maritima spermidine synthase, which prefers putrescine but is more tolerant of other substrates. Comparison of the structures of the human spermidine synthase with both substrates and products with the known structure of T. maritima spermidine synthase complexed to a multisubstrate analogue inhibitor and analysis of the properties of site-directed mutants provide a general mechanistic hypothesis for the aminopropyl transfer reaction. The studies also provide a structural basis for the specificity of the spermidine synthase subclass of the aminopropyltransferase family.
D2-62;Educational robotics offers a wealth of advantages, particularly in promoting interactive and hands-on learning, fostering creativity, and encouraging teamwork. By providing practical applications for theoretical concepts, it strengthens students' understanding of STEM subjects such as motion and forces. Adding to this, it equips students with technical skills relevant to modern industries and cater to various learning styles, including visual and kinesthetic learning, especially benefiting students with disabilities. Furthermore, robotics offers immediate feedback, enabling students to quickly identify and correct mistakes, which reinforces their learning process. Its fun and interactive nature boosts motivation and engagement, instilling a positive attitude toward education. In essence, educational robotics not only enhances academic learning but also prepares students for the demands of the 21st-century workforce.
D2-63;The use of insects for food represents a promising yet complex solution to address the growing need for sustainable food sources. Insects offer several advantages over traditional livestock, including lower resource requirements, such as land, water, and feed, and reduced environmental impact, emitting fewer greenhouse gases. They are rich in protein and essential nutrients, making them a healthy and potentially cost-effective alternative to conventional meat products. However, cultural perceptions and regulatory frameworks present significant barriers. Many Western societies are not accustomed to consuming insects, which may hinder widespread acceptance. Ensuring the safety and regulatory compliance of insect-based foods is also crucial. Additionally, developing efficient production and processing methods to scale up insect farming is essential for feasibility.
D2-64;Spermidine synthase (SpdS) is an enzyme responsible for producing spermidine, a polyamine essential for cell growth and proliferation. It typically exists as a homodimer or monomer, depending on the species, and has a Rossmann-like fold common in nucleotide-binding proteins. The enzyme’s active site binds putrescine and decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM), with key aspartate and glutamate residues facilitating catalysis. During the reaction, SpdS transfers an aminopropyl group from dcSAM to putrescine, forming spermidine and 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA). This process plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis, stress response, and DNA stabilization. The enzyme ensures efficient polyamine biosynthesis, which is crucial for cellular function and growth.
D2-65;Understanding Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) hydrology is essential for evaluating response of ice dynamics to a warming climate and future contributions to global sea level rise. Recently observed increases in temperature and melt extent over the GrIS have prompted numerous remote sensing, modeling, and field studies gauging the response of the ice sheet and outlet glaciers to increasing meltwater input, providing a quickly growing body of literature describing seasonal and annual development of the GrIS hydrologic system. This system is characterized by supraglacial streams and lakes that drain through moulins, providing an influx of meltwater into englacial and subglacial environments that increases basal sliding speeds of outlet glaciers in the short term.
D2-66;Computational systems biology is crucial for understanding the complexity of biological systems through the integration of mathematical modeling, computer simulations, and data analysis. It enables researchers to study how genes, proteins, and metabolic pathways interact in a holistic manner, rather than in isolation. This approach is essential for deciphering the dynamics of biological networks, such as gene regulatory networks, signaling pathways, and metabolic systems. The importance of computational systems biology lies in its ability to predict biological behaviors, identify potential drug targets, and develop personalized medicine strategies. It also helps in understanding diseases at a systems level, enabling the identification of biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.
D2-67;The Lavoisier Law, also known as the Law of Conservation of Mass, was formulated by French chemist Antoine Lavoisier in 1789. This law states that in a closed system, the total mass of the reactants is equal to the total mass of the products during a chemical reaction. In simpler terms, matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction; it only transforms from one form to another. This fundamental principle revolutionized chemistry, as it emphasized the importance of balancing chemical equations and understanding the fate of matter in reactions. The law laid the groundwork for modern chemical theory and remains a cornerstone of scientific understanding.
D2-68;The ultimate goal of metabolic engineering is to be able to use these organisms to produce valuable substances on an industrial scale in a cost-effective manner. Current examples include producing beer, wine, cheese, pharmaceuticals, and other biotechnology products.[2] Another possible area of use is the development of oil crops whose composition has been modified to improve their nutritional value.[3] Some of the common strategies used for metabolic engineering are (1) overexpressing the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme of the biosynthetic pathway, (2) blocking the competing metabolic pathways, (3) heterologous gene expression, and (4) enzyme engineering. Since cells use these metabolic networks for their survival, changes can have drastic effects on the cells' viability. 
D2-69;Lavoisier was born in 1743 into a wealthy family of lawyers, and initially prepared for a legal career, being awarded a baccalaureate in law in 1763. Antoine Lavoisier played the central role in what has come to be known as the chemical revolution and he was active also in agricultural and fiscal reform as well as technological development. He is credited with establishing that oxygen is an element and water its compound with hydrogen, refining experimental methods in chemistry, reforming chemical nomenclature along systematic lines, defining element operationally, and denying phlogiston a place in chemical explanation. This chapter critically examines the analytical conception of the elements that Lavoisier proposes.
D2-70;Lavoisier’s law, also known as the Law of Conservation of Mass, states that mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. This fundamental principle, proposed by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century, is crucial to the field of chemistry and science in general. It laid the foundation for modern chemistry by establishing that the total mass of reactants in a chemical reaction is equal to the total mass of products. This law enabled scientists to develop more accurate chemical equations and understand that chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms, not their creation or annihilation. Lavoisier’s law was vital in refuting earlier theories like the phlogiston theory and is key to stoichiometry.
D2-71;Metabolic engineering is the field of biotechnology that involves the modification of an organism’s metabolic pathways to enhance the production of desired products, such as chemicals, fuels, pharmaceuticals, or food ingredients. By altering or optimizing the flow of metabolites within cells, metabolic engineers aim to improve the efficiency and yield of biochemical processes. This is done through techniques like gene editing, overexpression of enzymes, and the introduction of new pathways. Metabolic engineering has applications in industrial biotechnology, where it enables the production of biofuels, antibiotics, and biodegradable plastics, and is also crucial for improving processes in medicine, agriculture, and environmental sustainability.
D2-72;Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field that combines biology with engineering, technology, and computational science to design and construct new biological parts, devices, and systems, or to redesign existing natural biological systems for specific purposes. It involves advanced genetic engineering techniques, such as CRISPR for gene editing and synthetic DNA construction, alongside computational modeling and bioprinting. Applications span medicine, environmental science, and industry, including the development of organisms capable of producing medications, biofuels, or addressing environmental challenges. While it holds great potential, synthetic biology also raises ethical considerations regarding the unintended consequences of engineered organisms and the responsible use of this technology to ensure societal benefits.
D2-73;Lamarck's ""Hydrogéologie"" (1802) represents a fascinating but often overlooked contribution to early geological thought. While Lamarck is primarily remembered for his evolutionary biology theories, this work showcases his broader scientific vision. In it, he proposed that Earth's features formed through gradual processes over immense time periods—challenging the catastrophist views popular in his era. The text emphasized water's crucial role in shaping landscapes and theorized about atmospheric influences on geological formations. Notably, Lamarck's uniformitarian approach in geology paralleled his biological thinking about gradual change. Though overshadowed by his biological works and contemporaries like Cuvier, Hydrogéologie demonstrates Lamarck's cross-disciplinary thinking and his willingness to challenge scientific orthodoxy across multiple fields.
D2-74;Greenland is the world’s largest island, located in the North Atlantic Ocean, and is an autonomous territory of Denmark. It is geographically part of North America but politically and historically connected to Europe. Greenland is known for its vast ice sheet, which covers about 80% of the island, making it a critical component of global climate systems. The island’s population is relatively small, primarily consisting of Inuit people. Its economy relies heavily on fishing, while tourism and mining are growing sectors. Greenland has significant natural resources, including minerals and oil, though environmental concerns and the impact of climate change, such as melting ice, are major issues. Greenland’s strategic location has also gained geopolitical importance in recent years.
D2-75;The Big Bang theory is an effort to explain what happened at the very beginning of our universe. Discoveries in astronomy and physics have shown beyond a reasonable doubt that our universe did in fact have a beginning. Prior to that moment there was nothing; during and after that moment there was something: our universe. The big bang theory is an effort to explain what happened during and after that moment. According to the standard theory, our universe sprang into existence as ""singularity"" around 13.7 billion years ago. What is a singularity and where does it come from? Well, Singularities are zones which defy our current understanding of physics. They are thought to exist at the core of black holes.
D2-76;Phthalates or phthalate esters, are esters of phthalic acid. They are mainly used as plasticizers, i.e., substances added to plastics to increase their flexibility, transparency, durability, and longevity. They are used primarily to soften polyvinyl chloride (PVC). While phthalates are commonly used as plasticizers, not all plasticizers are phthalates. The two terms are specific, unique, and not used interchangeably. Lower-molecular-weight phthalates are typically replaced in many products in the United States, Canada, and European Union over health concerns. They are being replaced by higher molecular-weight phthalates as well as non-phthalic plasticizers. Phthalates are commonly ingested in small quantities via the diet. There are numerous forms of phthalates not regulated by governments. One of the most  known phtalates is bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate.
D2-77;The possibility of extraterrestrial life is rooted in the abundance of potentially habitable environments and the presence of basic components necessary for life. In our solar system, planets like Mars and moons such as Europa and Enceladus show promise due to evidence of water, a key ingredient for life. Beyond our solar system, exoplanets in habitable zones, identified through missions like Kepler, suggest countless opportunities for life. However, while conditions may be favorable, the origin of life remains elusive, requiring the right environment, building blocks, and catalytic events. Detection of life relies heavily on advanced telescopes and space probes, with confirmation posing significant challenges. Regardless of current limitations, the search for extraterrestrial life continues.
D2-78;Since the mid-20th century, active research has taken place to look for signs of extraterrestrial life, encompassing searches for current and historic extraterrestrial life, and a narrower search for extraterrestrial intelligent life. Depending on the category of search, methods range from analysis of telescope and specimen data to radios used to detect and transmit communications. The concept of extraterrestrial life, particularly extraterrestrial intelligence, has had a major cultural impact, especially extraterrestrials in fiction. Science fiction has communicated scientific ideas, imagined a range of possibilities, and influenced public interest in and perspectives on extraterrestrial life. One shared space is the debate over the wisdom of attempting communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. Some encourage aggressive methods to try to contact intelligent extraterrestrial life.
D2-79;Greenland is as old as the rest of the earth. And it has no other name than Grønland or Grœnland both of which translate and even sound close to Greenland. The very first humans there were Vikings or Norse, which as government evolved became Denmark. Norway and Denmark, Iceland and Faroe Islands, even areas of England and Scotland ruled by Vikings came under a united Denmark. The story is Ingólgur Arnason wanted to discourage more people coming so named his discovery Iceland, but Eric the Red wanting to encourage settlers named his discovery Greenland although Greenland is more appropriate for Iceland and Iceland more appropriate for Greenland. Just consider them early examples of 5th Avenue Advertizing.
D2-80;A PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scan is a sophisticated medical imaging technique that reveals how tissues and organs function at the molecular level. Unlike CT or MRI scans that show anatomical structure, PET scans detect metabolic activity by using a radioactive tracer—typically a form of glucose—injected into the bloodstream. This tracer emits positrons that create signals detected by the scanner. Areas with higher metabolic activity, such as rapidly growing cancer cells, absorb more tracer and appear brighter on the resulting 3D images. PET scans are particularly valuable for diagnosing and monitoring cancer, neurological disorders like Alzheimer's, and cardiovascular conditions. The procedure is painless, typically takes 30 minutes to 2 hours, and exposes patients to minimal radiation.
D2-81;Educational robotics has a wide range of applications aimed at enhancing learning experiences and developing essential skills in students. One of its primary uses is to teach STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) concepts, providing hands-on learning through building, programming, and interacting with robots. It encourages critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. Robotics also supports the development of coding and computational thinking, as students learn to program robots to perform tasks and solve challenges. Furthermore, educational robotics promotes collaboration and teamwork, as many projects involve group work. In addition to its academic benefits, it can also be used to teach engineering principles, mechanical design, and mathematics in a practical, engaging way. Additionally, robotics fosters 21st-century skills like adaptability, perseverance, and communication.
D2-82;A PET scan (Positron Emission Tomography) is a medical imaging technique that allows doctors to observe the metabolic activity of tissues and organs in the body. It involves injecting a small amount of a radioactive tracer (a substance containing a radioactive atom) into the bloodstream. This tracer is typically a form of glucose that is metabolized by cells. The PET scanner detects the radiation emitted by the tracer, creating detailed images that show how tissues are functioning, rather than just their structure. PET scans are commonly used in the diagnosis and monitoring of conditions like cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders (such as Alzheimer’s disease). They are especially useful in identifying abnormal cell activity, which can help detect cancerous tumors.
D2-83;Metabolic engineering is a multidisciplinary field that applies principles of genetic engineering to modify cellular metabolism. Its goals encompass several key objectives: Production Optimization -  The fundamental aim of metabolic engineering is to mathematically model metabolic networks, calculate yields of useful products, and identify constraints in these networks. By applying genetic engineering techniques to modify these networks, researchers seek to increase product formation and overall process efficiency. Creating Industrial Cell Factories A primary purpose is to develop cell factories capable of producing cost-effective molecules at industrial scale. This involves optimizing existing biochemical pathways or introducing new pathway components, most commonly in bacteria, yeast, or plantsProcess Improvement.
D2-84;Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of ancient life, offering critical insights into Earth's history and evolution. They provide evidence of extinct species, helping scientists reconstruct past ecosystems and understand how life has changed over millions of years. Fossils reveal how species adapted, evolved, or became extinct, shedding light on the processes of natural selection and environmental changes. Additionally, they are used to date rock layers and determine the age of geological formations, aiding in the study of Earth's geologic timeline. Fossils also provide clues about ancient climates and environmental conditions, helping researchers understand past climate changes and their impacts. By studying fossils, we gain a deeper understanding of life's diversity, the history of our planet.
D2-85;A PET scan, or Positron Emission Tomography, is a sophisticated imaging technique used in healthcare to visualize the metabolic processes within the body. It involves the injection of a radioactive tracer, often a glucose analog, into the patient. As the tracer interacts with body tissues, it emits positrons, which collide with electrons, resulting in the release of gamma rays. These emissions are detected by the PET scanner, which constructs a detailed image showing the distribution and activity of the tracer within the body.
Unlike structural imaging methods such as CT scans or MRIs, a PET scan provides functional information, highlighting areas of high metabolic activity. This makes it particularly valuable in diagnosing and assessing conditions like cancer, heart disease,  neurological disorders.
D2-86;Robotic education is nothing but the Hybrid Education that is provided to students, education when integrated with technology and coding is called as Robotic education. Robotic education is far better than the traditional educational system because of it instructional based teaching. Coding is not preparing an application, it is just understanding the instructions in a sequence and then execution them in a way we need the result. Coding allows the users to create something, traditional education is all about learning that is there in book, where creativity, critical thinking, programming is neglected. As robotic education is based on algorithm (set of programmed instructions to execute in sequence) it triggers students to go one step ahead.
D2-87;Join any group of distance educators today and the chances are you will hear talk of exponential expansion of distance education when the information superhighways come into being, within a decade. This might be called the Big Bang theory of distance education. You will hear enthusiastic talk about two-way communication (at last) between teacher and student, replacing the old one-way systems of print, radio and television. At last, students everywhere will be able to explore massive knowledge stores. You may also hear gloomy comments about limited access, costs and the dangers of technological determinism. You may even hear critics who seriously decry the commodification of knowledge represented by distance education.
D2-88;Jean-Baptiste Lamarck’s Hydrogéologie (1802) proposed a holistic, steady-state geological model emphasizing uniformitarianism—the idea that gradual processes shape Earth’s surface over immense time. He theorized that continents erode eastward, with debris deposited westward via global currents, causing a slow continental migration. Lamarck integrated living organisms into Earth’s dynamics, arguing their metabolic activity drives the decomposition and recycling of materials, sustaining planetary equilibrium. This vision positioned biology as central to geology, pioneering ecological thinking by linking abiotic and biotic processes. However, his speculative approach—rooted in outdated four-element chemistry—drew criticism from contemporaries like Georges Cuvier and Antoine Lavoisier. Despite its flaws, Hydrogéologie laid groundwork for synthesizing Earth sciences, envisioning a unified “Physique terrestre” (terrestrial physics) combining meteorology, hydrogeology, and biology
D2-89;Greenland, the world's largest island that isn't a continent, covers 836,330 square miles in the North Atlantic, with approximately 80% of its surface covered by ice. An autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, Greenland has a population of about 56,000, predominantly Inuit. The capital, Nuuk, houses roughly one-third of its inhabitants. Despite its name, most of Greenland experiences Arctic conditions with limited vegetation. Its economy relies on fishing, tourism, and substantial mineral resources, including rare earth elements becoming increasingly valuable due to climate change. Greenlandic culture blends traditional Inuit practices with Scandinavian influences. Climate change poses significant challenges as the melting ice sheet contributes to global sea level rise while simultaneously opening new economic opportunities through increased resource accessibility.
D2-90;The principle of positron emission tomography (PET) is that radiation emitted from a radiopharmaceutical injected intravenously into a patient is registered by external detectors positioned at different orientations. This is a technology that is extremely useful in the detection and treatment of diseases like cancer. However, there is some confusion about how PET works. Before PET was introduced a different type of radiation imaging called SPECT (single-photon emission computerised tomography) was used. This technology was based on the pinhole camera technique whereby a reverse image of an object is obtained by passing the light through a small aperture or pinhole. 
D2-91;The Big Bang theory is the leading explanation for the origin of the universe. It posits that the universe began approximately 13.8 billion years ago from an extremely hot, dense state known as a singularity. This singularity then rapidly expanded in a process called cosmic inflation, causing space itself to stretch exponentially in a fraction of a second. As the universe expanded, it began to cool, allowing matter to form, leading to the creation of atoms, stars, galaxies, and eventually the structure of the universe we observe today. Key evidence supporting the Big Bang theory includes the cosmic microwave background radiation (a faint glow left over from the early universe), the abundance of light elements like hydrogen and helium.
D2-92;With the emergence of positron emission tomography (PET) from research laboratories into routine clinical use, it is important to redefine the most appropriate use of each imaging technique. The aim of this review article is to show the potential of PET in oncology. We discuss the most promising indications and the perspectives for the future. We will also point out the shortcomings and the important questions to be answered before fully considering PET as a necessary tool in the day-to-day practice of oncology. Although many studies have documented the high accuracy of 18F-FDG PET for the detection and staging of malignant tumours and for the monitoring of therapy results in these patients.
D2-93;Metabolic engineering is not another form of classic manipulation of intermediary metabolism; rather, it is the purposeful design of metabolic networks. The metabolic engineering approach examines biochemical reactions in their entirety, rather than individually, and is concerned with the construction of novel pathways, the thermodynamic feasibility of pathways, and the location of limiting branch-point(s) and enzymatic reaction(s) in a reaction network. The ultimate goal is the construction of strains with superior yield and productivity obtained through a convergent evolutionary process. Progress has been made toward this objective within the framework of Metabolic Control Analysis through the development of methodologies for the experimental determination of elasticities and flux control coefficients.
D2-94;Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field that combines principles from biology, engineering, and computer science to design and construct new biological parts, systems, and organisms or to re-engineer existing biological systems for specific purposes. It involves creating synthetic genetic circuits, modifying genomes, or designing artificial enzymes to carry out tasks that natural organisms cannot. The goal of synthetic biology is to apply engineering principles to biology, enabling the synthesis of novel compounds, the production of biofuels, the development of new therapeutics, and innovations in environmental sustainability. It has vast potential for applications in medicine, agriculture, energy, and biotechnology, but also raises important ethical and safety considerations.
D2-95;Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging technique that uses radioactive substances known as radiotracers to visualize and measure changes in metabolic processes, and in other physiological activities including blood flow, regional chemical composition, and absorption. Different tracers are used for various imaging purposes, depending on the target process within the body. PET is a common imaging technique, a medical scintillography technique used in nuclear medicine. A radiopharmaceutical – a radioisotope attached to a drug – is injected into the body as a tracer. When the radiopharmaceutical undergoes beta plus decay, a positron is emitted, and when the positron interacts with an ordinary electron, the two particles annihilate and two gamma rays are emitted in opposite directions.
D2-96;Though a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with the European kingdoms of Norway and Denmark for more than a millennium, beginning in 986.[19] Greenland has been inhabited at intervals over at least the last 4,500 years by circumpolar peoples whose forebears migrated there from what is now Canada.[20][21] Norsemen from Norway settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century (having previously settled Iceland), and their descendants lived in Greenland for 400 years until disappearing in the late 15th century. The 13th century saw the arrival of Inuit.
D2-97;There has been a steady increase in the number of studies investigating educational robotics and its impact on academic and social skills of young learners. Educational robots are used both in and out of school environments to enhance K–12 students’ interest, engagement, and academic achievement in various fields of STEM education. Some prior studies show evidence for the general benefits of educational robotics as being effective in providing impactful learning experiences. However, there appears to be a need to determine the specific benefits which have been achieved through robotics implementation in K–12 formal and informal learning settings. In this study, we present a systematic review of the literature on K–12 educational robotics.
D2-98;Plasticizers like phthalates were thought to be mainly hormone disruptors. They caused fertility problems and adverse developmental effects. Surprisingly, since the 2000s researchers noted that they were instrumental in causing obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Another key point, phthalates can be absorbed through the skin, ingested by mouth or inhaled. In order to understand how phthalates cause cardiovascular disease, we need to investigate the effects of phthalates on fatty tissue. Phthalates have a negative effect on fatty tissue that leads to adipose tissue dysfunction. Fat cells develop out of adipose stem cells committing themselves and maturing into fatty cells that can store lipids. This process has the name adipogenesis.
D2-99;The main causes of lung cancer are multifaceted and involve a combination of lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors. The most significant risk factor is smoking, including both active smoking and secondhand exposure. Cigarettes release numerous harmful chemicals that damage lung cells over time, increasing the likelihood of cancer development. While not everyone who smokes develops lung cancer, the risk is considerably higher for smokers compared to non-smokers. Radon, a radioactive gas found in certain soil types, is another major contributor. It can accumulate in homes and buildings, posing a long-term health risk if exposure levels are high. Outdoor and indoor air pollution, such as emissions from vehicles and industrial activities, as well as cooking fumes from coal or wood.
D2-100;It is an approximation useful in chemistry, but not strictly correct. It is not, in general, obeyed by nuclear reactions, or even in one common medical procedure, PET scanning (positron emission tomography). In this procedure, radioactive variants of common drug or body chemicals are injected into a patient under observation. Some of a particular radioactive chemical element or elements are radioactive in a particular way—they are neutron-light. Their nuclear reactions in the body are similar to beta-decay of neutron-heavy elements, except that the “electrons” released are not electrons, but the corresponding anti-matter: positrons. As anti-matter, positrons are quite unwelcome in ordinary matter—the patient—and very quickly encounter electrons, annihilating each electron-positron pair.
